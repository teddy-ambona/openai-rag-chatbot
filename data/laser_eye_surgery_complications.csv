The complainant described scarring of her left cornea as a result of complications with maintaining suction pressure during the cutting operation which took place during lasik refractive surgical procedure performed at a clinic on 12/4/97. During visits to the clinic on 7/24 and 29/98, investigator learned the attending physician used a micro keratome (cutting/suction device) called the ""flapmaker"" to cut the cornea, and then used visx star (model c) excimer laser to dissolve cornea tissue underlying the corneal flap. The laser appears to be approved for use with prk surgery and was used by the physician for lasik surgery under med discretion in consultation with his pt. Dr became aware of this ""flapmaker"" at a meeting in october 1997. The clinic purchased the ""flapmaker"" in december 1997 from refractive technologies, inc, cleveland, ohio and Dr has used this device for lasik procedures at his eye surgery clinic since that time. She said her sister, who was very nearsighted, had the surgery at the clinic with good success-she did not have to wear eye glasses following the surgery. Her sister had prk in one eye and lasik in the other eye. The complainant felt this clinic was well known and had been in business for a long time, so she made an appointment for a consultation about the surgery. In november, 1997, at the consultation, she saw a refractive surgery coord who gave her an eye exam which included an eye scan to evaluate the tomography of her eyes. She was told she did not qualify for prk surgery because her eyes were too myopic, but she was a good candidate for lasik surgery and would not need to wear eye glasses following the surgery. She told reporter her vision was -10.2 right eye and -11.5 left eye. Dr said her astigmatism was minor and she wouldn't need an added piece for surgery.

246265,1999-10-19,"Doctor performed photorefractive keratectomy with the excimer laser. Dr never discussed complications and risks involved in this procedure. Never discussed adverse effects on intermediate vision. The problem is not necessarily with the product but the fact that doctors are performing this surgery on anyone. According to rptr articles have appeared in time magazine and on national television warning people to investigate this procedure thoroughly. During a yearly eye check up, rptr's roommate, a Dr and herslf had a brief discussion on option of lasik corrective eye surgery, as opposed to wearing glasses. Because this was a new procedure for Dr, roommate asked if she could be a ""guinea pig."" he agreed and offered her a considerable discount on procedure. He offered rptr the same option. He had several appointments with roommate prior to surgery, some which rptr accompanied her to. During this surgery Dr is required to use a ""flap cutter"" on eye prior to laser process. During her surgery flap cutter he was using was the incorrect size and they had to abort, choosing to reschedule her at a later date. Then scheduled rptr's surgery for a friday, so she would be able to return to work on monday(which was impossible). On friday 6/4/99 Dr cut a small ""flap"" on rptr's right eye & proceeded with laser process. Procedure on left eye was not as simple. Dr had to try 2 different size ""flap-cutters"" before he was successful with third. This was an extremely uncomfortable, painful and frightening situation. He then proceeded with laser process on left. Because of these experiences, Dr decided to stop using these cutters & changed to another mfr. Rptr had a follow-up visit on 6/5 to examine eyes & condition of flaps. Rptr was already beginning to see ""distance"" a bit clearer, but vision within 5 ft was a complete blur. 6/11/99 appointment was to check condition of eyes & measure distance vision, which was getting more clear, but predominantly in left eye. Rptr told Dr that she was extremely concerned about intermediate vision which was completely blurry. It was only then that he notified rptr that her intermediate vision was going to be impaired. Rptr was extremely upset. On 6/24, 7/7 & 7/15 rptr & Dr discussed this intermediate vision problem. Rptr was frustrated, stressed & impossible to live with. Dr suggested trying a ""mono vision"" solution. This entails wearing one contact lens in one eye for distance and one lens in other for ""reading & intermediate"" vision. 7/23/99 rptr rec'd lenses. For several weeks rptr tried lenses but could not deal with discomfort or adjust to situation. Now both her near vision & intermediate vision is severely impaired. Distance vision in right eye is still blurred. Prior to this ""corrective surgery"" rptr wore progressive lens glasses to improve her moderate nearsightedness & farsightedness. She functioned quite well without glasses & just used them to enhance vision. Now rptr must rely on glasses for almost everything she does; simplest of tasks require glasses. Rptr never reached for glasses first thing in morning. Now she does need them to eat, comb hair, look at a watch or clock, tie shoes, etc. During 8/19 discussion with Dr, rptr made it clear that info he gave rptr prior to surgery was inaccurate. ""that I would only be required to wear glasses to read."" if rptr had known what results of surgery would be rptr would never have had procedure. He discussed her being a good candidate for surgery prior to it, but rptr asks what constitutes a good candidate. What he determined was health of eyes, not her day to day activities. He never discussed what she did for a living(computer sales), how she spent a majority of time, or how her age might effect outcome. He has since explained that this surgery after age 45 cannot guarantee best results. He repeatedly referred to her distance vision, and how she would be able to participate in sports. He told her he had discussions with her roommate prior to her surgery, & because she was there for a majority of her visits, he didn't think to go over this again with her. During a phone conversation 8/25 Dr told her that there was no way he could spend all the time necessary to discuss all possible results of procedure.

248869,1999-11-05,"Rptr's eyes have been permanently damaged by lasik surgery ""an inherently dangerous procedure which is poorly regulated in this country."" rptr has written an article to inform others of the dangers of lasik surgery. Rptr wishes action be taken regarding a procedure that has already ""caused hundreds of cases of damaged eyes throughout the country, and could cause many thousands more in the coming months. The fda opthalmological devices panel, which has approved the procedure, is comprised of individuals who all have a stake in the lasik business, given that they all perform substantial numbers of lasik surgeries."" rptr must now go through life with a visual impairment due to a medical procedure that Drs are touting without warning their pts of the inherent risks. Lasik eye surgery - one student's nightmare and a warning to others: ""I once met a woman who told me how, in the 1960s, she had been one of the first people to use contact lenses. It turns out that these early versions of contact lenses blocked the flow of so much oxygen to the cornea that she was left with permanent damage to her eyes. I remember thinking that I would never commit a similar mistake by subjecting my body to any product or procedure that had not been thoroughly tested and had withstood the ultimate test - the test of time. Over the years, however, life's lessons can be forgotten or at least fade in intensity. So it was that 3 months ago I too was seduced by intensive marketing of a new procedure, overlooked the important lession I once knew, and underwent lasik surgery on my eyes in an effort to eliminate my need for eyeglasses. What follows is an overview of lasik, its benefits, the minor Drawbacks you'll typically hear about, and the serious dangers of lasik surgery to people with higher degrees of nearsightedness. These dangers are becoming more widely understood by ophthalmologists who perform lasik, but many surgeons still do not recognize the dangers or clearly warn their pts about them. The lasik procedure - in lasik the surgeon cuts a 3-sided flap on the outermost layer of the eye, the epithelium. This layer is then folded back to expose the cornea, which is then subjected to a 6.5 mm laser beam which ablates tissue in order to produce a shape that will now focus light directly onto the optic nerve as opposed to in front of it (myopia) or in a distorted way (astigmatism). The flap is folded back onto the eye, and no stitches are needed because the epithelium adheres quickly to the cornea. The flap can be relifted up to a year after the initial procedure in case another lasing is needed to fine tune the results. This is usually not needed for people who previously had low to moderate prescriptions (under 4 diopters), and such people will typically see 20/20 immediately following the surgery (o diopters). But another surgery is typically needed for those who previously had prescription of over 4 diopters. The entire lasik procedure lasts only 15 mins, making it seem almost trivial. The fact that about 400,000 lasik procedures were done in 1998 and even more are expected by the end of 1999 also lends support to this conception. Lasik ""treatment"" vs lasik surgery - many Drs and laser mfr refer to lasik as a ""treatment"" for myopia, thus implying that it ought to be done. In their view, the over hundred million eyeglass wearers in this country are diseased and ought to actively be seeking a cure beyond just wearing eyeglasses. This article refers to lasik as ""surgery"", for it is nothing less than a dangerous surgical procedure that should not be taken lightly. Most young people have never had surgery and might be unaware of how serious it is. I was unaware of the seriousness of lasik, and weighed what appeared to be a minor outpatient procedure with the enormous appeal of being rid of my glasses forever. I was never told about the lengthy recuperation process. I was not told about the Dry eyes, the cloudy vision, the eye pain, the inability to read comfortably for several months, and a host of other short-term symptoMs. And, worst of all, I had no idea that those with myopia of greater than 4 diopters are at substantially increased risk of permanently worse low light and night vision, double vision (known as ghosting), and haloes and starbursting around lights at night. Fda panel recommendation: the fda has done very little to protect people from lasik. For two years the fda essentially ignored the fact that hundreds of thousands of lasik surgeries were being done in this country. The fda wasn't concerned about the consequences of lasik surgery as long as pts signed a waiver form acknowledging that lasik was an 'off-label"" use of the laser (the intended use being prk, a relatively outdated procedure). In july of this year, the fda finally convened a set of hearings to look into lasik a bit further. A panel of ophthalmologists met for two days and, despite the fact that many of the scientists on the panel had never performed systematic statistical studies of the consequences of lasik to high myopes, the panel recommended that lasik (as performed on the visx model c start excimer, the most popular laser for lasik) be approved by the fda for up to 12 diopters of myopia (nearsightedness) and 4 diopters of astigmatism. In a feeble gesture of protectiveness, the panel recommended that the visx model c (star) excimer be required to have affixed to it a warning label stating that ""poorer visual outcomes may be anticipated in myopia of 10 diopters and above."" furthermore, the warning label should contain a statement that ""significant visual symptoMs such as glare and haloes may be worse in pts with larger pupils."" exactly how a pt entering an operting room for the first time would know to look for such a warning label, particularly after having taken valium and having his pupils dilated prior to surgery, was left unstated by the fda panel.

Floaters are common in people in their 50's or 60's. Also rptr has a very large number of them. Rptr's own eye Dr said rptr has a lot of them that they never had before, and that they can be the result of lasik. Rptr's vision is much poorer than it ever was, especially given the fact that nothing can be done about the floaters according to several Drs.

321365,2001-03-16,"Pt has undergone photorefractive keratectomy (prk) at hosp in a foreign country with a fda approved excimer laser, I.e. The apexplus of the co summit technology. The purpose of the treatment was correction of myopia which was determined as follows: -7.3 diopters of myopia (d) and -1.75 d of astigmatism on the right eye and -6.8 d of myopia and -1.5 d of astigmatism on the left eye. The treatment was performed with an ablation zone of 6.5 mm. Up to today, at a distance of almost 5 years from the treatment, pt suffers from halos and glare and complains about bad vision at night. In order to collect more info about the device itself, rptr had a look at the documentation put on the internet and downloaded approval p930034 of 10/25/95, the only one that matched the device description and the date. Inside the documents rptr found some criteria which have to be met in order to ensure that the device is suitable for a certain pt. In the fda letter to summit of 10/20/95 rptr found under restrictions of use that the device is suitable for ""moderate nearsightedness (-1.5 to 7.0 diopters when concomitant astigmatism is no greater than 1.5 diopters)..."". In addition it is clearly specified as not indicated to correct high myopia (nearsightedness > -7.0 d). So, as mentioned above, the actual values of myopia and astigmatism exceeded the specified ones. As far as it regards the ablation zone rptr found an indication that the device was approved for a 6.0 mm ablation area, while during the treatment a 6.5 mm diameter was used. So rptr's first question is whether there were amendments to the approval p930034. According to which the corrected values would have been inside an admittable range of new values or was the device used off-label ie outside the indicated limits. Rptr understood from the literature published before procedure date that the probleMs, pt is reporting, could be due to optical zone edge effects, especially when the pupil is dilated. Moreover I learned from the documentation, put on the internet, that large pupils have to be considered as a risk factor as far as it regards occurrence of glare and halos after refractive surgery. According to a survey, performed on pt in 10/99, the ablation was of good homogenity, it was perfectly centered and it had an usuable optical area of 4 mm on the right eye and of 4.5 mm on the left eye. Thus the Dr stated on his report that the reason for the pt's probleMs has to be the pupillary diameter which is bigger than the treated area (rptr supposes he refers to the usable optical area and not to the abaltion zone). So rptr's second question is whether fda issued some specifications or amendments to approval which deal with long term risks of debilitating symptoMs related to the pupillary diameter, its dynamics and the dimensions of the ablation area.",Ablations; Halos; Glares; Night Issues; Astigmatism

500873,2003-11-24,"Lasik with the nidek ec5000 aside from known complications caused a difficult-to-describe, severe loss of vision quality in ordinary daytime indoor and outdoor lighting in anything less than bright daylight, and at night including severe Dry eyes, monocular diplopia in some lighting conditions (both eyes), ghosting, haze, glare, halos, starbursts, floaters, blur, fuzz, and visual aberrations-distortions occurring in both 2 and 3 dimensions, contrast sensitivity reduction, chronic and intermittent pain (eyelids and eye) at different times, treated by restasis, and loss of quality of life so severe that the loss adversely effects stream of consciousness (see psychological literature) every single day and every single night. Vision probleMs are increasingly worse at distance than nearby, and see rays of light extending upwards. Eyes both suffered a permanent injury that will never heal completely. Pt was told it would heal in a matter days. If pt's current Dr cannot observe the abnormalities, then all the observable complications that occurred along the way, including striae, must have resolved to the point where they no longer affect vision. There were no mechanical probleMs, device failures or unpredicted probleMs, everything was a standard ordinary lasik according to the surgeon. However, pt is thinking about their eyes and vision constantly. Pt wasn't even told which light to look at. Pt asks if this is contrary to the manufcturer's directions (telling the pt the correct color or blinking light to look at). There is a study indicating that greater than 1.5 diopters of irregular astigmatism can cause diplopia, but pt's Dr cannot find objective evidence of those abnormalities in pt's eyes. Pt paid for someone who sat on the fda panel that reviewed these lasers and he cannot fix it. Pt asks why lasik has itself without any observable complications effected them and how had such a severe adverse effect on the rest of their life and thereby their family. Pt's Dr cannot find the objective evidence of those abnormalities even after he looked at everything there is to look at. The tests results are consistent with people we see who've had lasik and are happy with it and who do not have the difficulty pt is having. Before lasik pt had about 5 diopters of myopia and about 1 to 1.5 diopters of astigmatism, which is considered moderately nearsighted, with better than 20/20 bcva (20/15) and excellent vision quality in both eyes. Pt had the safest procedure possible at the time according to the center. They didn't mind wearing eyeglasses and safety was pt's main concern. Pt's current doctor offered to do further lasik on pt's better nearsighted eye, but how can pt risk their better eye when their worse eye has lost vision from an unk cause? If people are so severly injured that they require ""humanitarian"" aid and even that can't fix it in some cases (ladarvision has a humanitarian device approval) but even that con't fix pt's probleMs and all the devices available today capable of detecting coma, trefoil, and other types of higher order aberrations aren't sufficient to allow a Dr, who sits on the fda's ophthalmic devices panel, to observe the cause of a severe loss of vision quality. Pt asks how can the fda and the ophthalmic devices panel in all honesty refer to something as safe to use. Pt asks if Dr indicated lasik is known to cause these probleMs, then can they not be observed because they occur so commonly, and the severity of the effect and resulting suffering varies depending on some other unk factors. 1. The shape of the eye was flattened when it is naturally prolate egg shaped. This is known to cause higher order abberrations. 2. The ablation (the cut made by the laser) may not be centered on the visual axis in many cases causing the vision correction to not be centered. Pt asks if the newer devices provide more margin of error by centering on the visual axis instead of the pupil itself. 3. The size and shape of the final ablation zone is not large enough in many cases due to a number of factors including pupil size, healing, the taper zone and nonsymmetrical ablation shape in cases of pre-existing astigmatism; pupil size and the ablation zone in laser refractive surgery: considerations based on geometric optics, j cataract refract surg. 2003 oct.: 1924. 4. Class iiI lasers like the ec5000 have long been known to routinely cause irregular astigmatism that can and does ruin people's vision and their lives. It's now known that other class iiI medical devices have better results. 5. Are there other known factors that can cause severe unobservable probleMs in some individuals like poor corneal healing even at the cellular level or Dry eyes? Are these types of probleMs reported to the fda as adverse events or even listed as ""complications"" in the research used to approve these devices? Do over half of all people who have lasik permanently lose some vision? According to pt, lasik commonly causes increased rMs error, loss of contrast sensitivity, and other vision quality probleMs caused by these class iiI most dangerous devices. Additional complications pt had that where ruled out by their Dr as the cause of the vision problem, dlk, scar tissue, overturned flap, flap melt missing a piece of cornea, epithelial defect (>1), irregular astigmatism, flattened cornea (shape of the cornea was changed from prolate to oblate), restasis for inflammation, possibly caused by flap melt, the uvc light from laser causing radiation burn, immune reaction to be flap, or metal fragments stuck in eye.",Ablations; Halos; Starbursts; Glares; Dryness; Epithelial Issues; DLK; Flap Issues; Night Issues; Astigmatism; Pain

550604,2004-07-26,"Reporter writing to report an adverse event regarding reporter's eye injury incurred in a fda hyperopic lasik trial. This clinical trial was sponsored by visx and was done at eye laser center in 2000. Prior to the lasik, reporter had pre-existent irregular astigmatism from decentration and should have been excluded from the clinical trial. However, reporter was misinformed of the risk/benefit of lasik treatment of decentration and was inappropriately included in the clinical trail with a investigational device -- one that had clearly no known therapeutic benefit and is unsafe to use with reporter's condition -- which resulted in injury. Since the surgery, the investigator has minimized reporter's symptoMs, withheld a full workup, failed to make a mandatory report to sponsoring mfr, the irb, or fda. The investigator led reporter to believe that the investigator/sponsor of the trial would do the responsible thing while nothing has happened in the 4 years since surgery to redress eye injury. The investigator has delayed and now refused a needed re-treatment to remedy reporter corneal injury. Below is a summary of the events: prior to the fda clinical trial, reporter right eye had pre-existent irregular astigmatism, which developed after a decentered prk using visx star s2 at eye laser center in 6/1998. This corneal irregular astigmatism was examined and diagnosed by ophthalmologists. With this condition, reporter had suffered from a minor double image/halo that would resolve completely in well lit condition. Reporter's ophthalmologists told reporter that there were no known treatment at that time and suggested that reporter see another Dr. See if there are any other treatment options. 10/1999, reporter went to the Dr for a second opinion and he offered to treat condition with lasik using visx star s2 as part of a hyperopic lasik fda clinical trial. Reporter deferred making a decision to undergo surgery. In 1/2000, reporter received a call from Dr office with an offer of 50% discount, soliciting reporter to have lasik done. When reporter followed up with this Dr. In 2/2000, he reassured reporter that the procedure would be safe and effective despite the investigational device status, and that in the event that result is not optimal, re-treatment would be done promptly and be free of charge. Given such reassurance, reporter underwent the surgery in 2004. After lasik, vision deteriorated -- the halo/starburst have gotten much worse and reporter's right eye now sees up to 5 double images as opposed to just 1 before, and they do not resolve even in well lit conditions. Reporter has also lost depth perception now that everything is fuzzy with debilitating glare, halo, and multiple doubles in reporter's right eye. Reporter first reported this to Dr the day after the surgery, that something had gone terribly wrong and reporter would like to have the changes undone, but Dr told reporter ""everything looked fine"", dismissed reporter's symptoMs while these symptoMs had been clearly documented in reporter's medical records. Dr never appropriately entered these adverse reactions following lasik on the case report form, nor were any adverse event forMs/reports ever filed with visx. No investigation was ever initiated by the visx to assess the cause of reporter visual deterioration after lasik. While Dr withheld a full workup, he misinformed reporter that reporter's deteriorated vision was due to ""compound myopic astigmatism"", that a new wavefront lasik would be available in 6 months to address condition. He has been asking reporter to wait for re-treatment, giving reporter a different date for wavefront lasik each time reporter visit. In 4/2002, reporter received a note from Dr's office that the re-treatment with wavefront lasik will be possible in ""12-24 months."" in 5/2002, reporter saw Dr and he ordered an undilated wavefront test on reporter's eye. When asked what the result meant, Dr told reporter, ""I don't know"" asked reporter to continue to wait for a new wavefront-coupled lasik. In 5/2003, reporter went to an outside corneal specialist and received a properly dilated wavefront test on eye. This test revealed serious optical aberration on reporter's cornea, which is in excess of 100% more than the wavefront test shown in 2002. Reporter wrote again in 4/2004 informing Dr of the new wavefront test result and for re-treatment.

Reporter had a pre-existent decentered ablation on their right cornea from prk with visx star s2 in 1998, and had minor diplopia from their right eye from the irregular astigmatism. Reporter was mis-informed of the risk of using lasik to treat decentration by the clinical investigator, at eye laser center; and was inappropriately included in the visx hyperoptic lasik study.

When greeted, no apologies were given for the wait time; rather she had admitted that she had forgotten about the appointment. This was my first taste of how insignificant my importance was to the office. At the end of the appointment, I was promised that I would be contacted the next day to schedule my visit with Dr so he could determine if I was a candidate for the surgery. Three days went by with no phone call, which prompted my follow up. I was scheduled for an appointment the next week.  During the appointment, Dr seemed to rush through his evaluation of my eyes as he rapidly switched lenses on the testing devices and almost answered the question of ""which is clear"" before I had the chance to respond. The doctor did determine that I was a candidate; but would require a special procedure as my eyes did not have a smooth surface. When I asked questions about the differences in the procedures, he seemed very disinterested and I felt rushed. I was originally scheduled for lasik for on one day. I was encouraged to take the day off from work and had done so. Because you are unable to Drive home after the surgery, you also have to line up a Driver. A family member came in from another state and needed to take 2 days off of work to assist me.

While they followed up by indicating that they were only joking it certainly didn't make me feel at ease. While in the operating room, Dr made several forceful remarks to me requesting that I keep still. His remarks were loud and gave me the perception that he was yelling. After he completed the first eye he wanted to quickly go to the second. When I asked for a couple of minutes to unwind from the first procedure, he agreed; but by his voice inflection, I could tell he was not happy with the request. -again, I felt rushed and the Dr did not give me the perception that my surgery was important - rather another pt to get done-.  Overall the surgery went well and my vision has significantly improved. While the quality of work is not in question, I was dissatisfied by the lack of professionalism and the lack of appreciation and concern the entire staff demonstrated during my consulation visits with the Dr and administrative staff. Feeling rushed, especially for a surgery that could cause blindness does not make one feel comfortable.  While my general ophthalmologist referred me; he has also in fairness warned me about Dr and his practice. I am hopeful that this will create some pause for concern and maybe raise some awarness in the need for the Dr to treat his pts with better care and slow down; because one day his attitude and lack of ability to slow down will result in a mistake.",

She underwent bilateral lasik on the ladarvision 4000 unit in 2001, with a full myopic correction and a 6.5 mm optical zone diameter programmed for both eye. The right eye was treated first. Both surgeries were performed by a senior experienced refractive surgeon without ablation interruption and no other atypical events were noted. Day 1 post-op, the pt reported that her ucva right eye was unchanged compared to pre-op and she could perceive a subjective improvement in the ucva left eye. Autorefraction showed -2.00 -0.25 x 90 right, -0.75 sphere left. Repeat right eye pachymetry on post-op day 1 performed multiple times showed a decrease in corneal thickness much less than expected based on the calculated ablation depth. The surgeon expressed the opinion to laser center staff that the laser energy did not contact the pt's right cornea. Post-operative topography performed in  2001 revealed a barely perceptible area of central flattening in the right eye; that for the left eye showed a centered symmetric ablation with a small effective optical zone -about 2.5 -3 mm-. Subjective vision complaints reported during the post-op period included trouble reading words on television and inability to Drive at night. Subsequent right eye retreatment in 2002 with a standard ablation algorithm for the residual refractive error led to extensive epithelial ingrowth.

809132,2007-01-23,"Pt was scheduled for bilateral lasik in 2002. Before her surgery, vision was 20/400 in the left eye and approximately 20/1600 in the right eye. The doctor began by performing the surgery on right eye. After preparing the eye for the surgery by applying numbing Drops and using the wire lid speculum, he used a 130 micron moria microkeratome head. He examined the blade, placed it into the head of the microkeratome, and then screwed the head into the motor. Then, he tested the microkeratome on the suction ring. All of the equipment, including the motor, appeared to be in good working order. He then placed the suction ring on eye. Once the pressure was acceptable, he attached the microkeratome to the suction ring and made the cut. After he returned the microkeratome to its original position, he realized that the flap was a buttonhole. The doctor then inspected the microkeratome blade and head and did not find any damage. But, to be safe, the doctor replaced the blade and the motor. He again tested all of the equipment before he used the microkeratome to cut the corneal flap on the left eye. The flap in the left eye was a buttonhole as well. He did not perform laser treatment on either eye. The doctor sent pt home applying a bandage contact lens and prescribing a regimen of medicated Drops. At the first post-operative visit on the next day, pt's vision was correctable to 20/60. Four days after the surgery, ptcame in for a second post-operative visit. The doctor noted that flaps were healing well but that the interface was irregular. Pt'svision was correctable to 20/40 in the right eye and 20/80 in the left. Pt did not visit the physician after the second post-operative visit and moria does not have any additional information about pt's condition. While the surgery took place in 2002, moria only learned of the surgery when pt's counsel recently contacted moria in connection with lawsuit against the surgeon who performed the lasik. After reviewing the records, moria decided to report this incident because it is an adverse event caused by user error. Pt had unusually steep corneas at 46 diopters which put them at special risk for buttonholes. The doctor did not properly account for the steepness of pt's corneas when he chose a microkeratome head that would have yielded a thinner cut. To prevent buttonholes, a physician should use a microkeratome head that would result in a thicker flap moreover, the buttonhole is not consistent with a malfunctioning motor or defective blade. Either of those probleMs would have led to a jagged cut rather than a buttonhole.",Flap Issues

897583,2007-08-11,"First off, I am so surprised to see how many people have had bad outcomes with there lasik/lasek surgery. For a moment, after hearing about all of the people that had good results, I thought that I was the only one who a received bad. I see now that this is not nearly the case. I am a family physician who had been wearing glasses since my 3rd grade year in school and just recently I got fed up with my glasses at the age of 28. My prescription had gotten so strong that it would cause me to have headaches and at the end of each day, it felt like my eyes were screenburned. I finally got a consultation to see a lasek Dr to which I had been referred to by an optometrist to which I felt comfortable with. After a long discussion, thought and prayer, I decided to go ahead and have the surgery done but with only one eye done at a time. My original prescription in my glasses was about -6.25 in the right eye and -6.175 in the left eye. My Dr told me that this was about the average set of eyes that he operated on. So, I had the right one done first, which was my worse eye. He did tell me that it would take about 3-4 weeks before the eye was completely healed and that is when I would have my best vision. After the surgery, everything was blurry and then about 2-3 days later, I started to get my vision back. I must say that the way that my right eye turned out after 4 weeks was excellent!!!!!! So, I waited another month before I decided to get the other eye done, thinking that since the first one was done so well, why not get the other one done as well, but still a little cautious of my left eye getting screwed up. Well, I had the left one done as well and the night of the surgery day after going to sleep, I noticed that my eye was in excrutiating pain as if something were in it. He does put a protective soft lens over your eye post-op, but it did not hurt like this on the right eye. I started to panic and quickly called my Dr. He said if the contact is still in, don't worry. So after about two weeks and removal of the contact, the next thursday after the surgery, I started to get some vision back. Although a slower recovery of vision that the right eye. I noticed that the letters that I was seeing were micro compared to the right eye. Then I knew that I had been overcorrected in the left eye, my best eye. Now, I was farsighted in the left eye. After seeing my Dr, the following week, he stated that I could see 20/15 in the left eye and that I had been overcorrected about +0.5. My heart sunk and I thought that I was going to die. He told me that I should continue to use npd which is an antibiotic/steroid solution that he used 2 times/daily and flarex in the right eye 2 times/daily and that he thought that my slight overcorrection would even out. I have doubts about this ever evening out. I am not having surgery again and have vowed to tell everyone considering lasek/lasek that if they are comfortable with their glasses/contacts, then keep them. Lasik/lasek really should be banned because it is an elective procedure that can possibly ruin your quality of life even though it will not kill you, you could be permanently debilitated behind it. The main reason that it should be banned is because the Drs that do it are not able to fix all the mistakes that can occur. This is one of the most immoral practices that I have ever seen in my medical career and its sickening to know the Drs, people who have taken the same hippocratic oath that I have are doing this procedure knowing that if some mistakes happen, and they do, that they can not fix them. Wow!!!. My eyes are open even wider now to patients needs and considerations of what it is that is bothering them. A lot of things that are going on with people are completely avoidable if only given the right info before making a decision. Lasek/lasik is one of the headaches that I really wish I did not do . It has slown me down considerably as a physician and as a young man who was able to do alot of things before lasik. But I still thank god though, even in my stupidity, my eyes could have turned out worse. I am now about 3 months post-op from lasek surgery and my night vision is almost as if I am in a pitch black movie and I can not Drive at night anymore. If I had known that the wider your pupils are after being dilated, the worse your night vision will be, I definitely would not have done this. With the overcorrection in my left eye, I am in a constant state of vertigo/imbalance that causes me sever fatigue. My vision feels as if it is fading a little bit everyday. What really bothers me is that when I discuss these things with my surgeon, he basically denies that they are due to the surgery event though he knows that I have been overcorrected in one eye. It is sickening to know that money has taken over an area of medicine like this at the cost of the quality of people's lives. I don't know if the bad reports are being ignored or they are not being reported, but I want someone to know that these complaints are for real. I am a real person and I am so tired of people being scared to say that their surgery did not come out as expected because of possible litigation. Something needs to be done. If the doctors are not capable of fixing all the potential mistakes that can happen with this, it needs to be banned. There needs to be more informed concent about what can really happen with your particular case of eyes I was given none of the really bad things that could happened. I am now disabled and trying to get disability which is even harder. Not sure which laser was used perform lasek, but used at eye center.",OverCorrection; Night Issues; Pain

926130,2007-10-06,"Over 3 and half years ago, laser eye surgery robbed a boy of his innocence. In 2004 was, by far, the most life altering experience I have ever had. This surgery ruined over 20 years of hard work and dedication. The same year, you performed wavefront guided laser eye surgery on my virgin corneas. At the time, my scoptic pupils were measured at well over 8mm. The optical zone imposed on my corneas for surgery was 6mm. Therefore, you operated on my eyes, knowing that anytime my pupils dilated over 6mm, my eyesight would be worthless. Since no aberrometer at the time of my surgery was able to evaluate corneas over 6 to 6.5mm, any ""blend zone"" given on my eyes was worthless. Only 6 of 8.25mMs of my eyes rec'd the full treatment from the surgery. It is my estimate that I spend over 75% of the day with my pupils larger than the given optical zone, thus rendering my vision absolutely worthless the majority of the day. For the rest of my life, I will suffer from pure visual hell. I have severe glare, star bursting, double vision, severely Dry eyes, trace cataracts, severe light sensitivity, severe floaters -a result from the combination of pilocarpine and the microkeratome used for the mutilation of my cornea flap-, and a decentered ablation. In addition, within my optical zone, there was an increase in high order aberrations -hoa-, including coma. On top of all this, I now have irregular astigmatism as well. All this is a direct result from the surgery. One can only imagine the psychological side effects this has caused for me. I have since been completely unemployed, as of several months after the surgery. I left to study abroad because I believed you, and even trusted you after my surgery. You told me that another surgery could help. So I waited to be sure, I waited for surgery methods to improve. Instead of working, I went back to school, and tried to read and study as best I could considering the circuMstances. I used the motivation of ""fixing"" my eyes to fuel me through graduate school. I looked forward every day to be ""healed."" however, after my arrival back in the u.s., after being out of the country for one yr, I went directly to your office to hear if you could help me. You said that another surgery could possibly help. You wanted to destroy more of my corneal tissue and perform a surgery to fix what you have caused. Your intention was never to increase my optical zone, which I now know is the real problem which you never admitted to and repeatedly lied about. You said, the typical response that I am ""one of the 1 or 2% of post refractive surgery patients with unsuccessful results but keep waiting, your eyes need to heal over time."" real textbook wording on how to avoid a lawsuit and allow my statute of limitations to pass by. Any financial settlement brought about from a litigation case against you would have been fair and just. It would have helped restore some stability in my life and allow me to put myself back on my feet. But your cunning tactics to let the statute of limitations pass me by was remarkable. Through your lies about healing time, to your lies about not knowing the cause of my probleMs, you covered yourself well. But as a result, you ruined my life and my family's lives as well. I have cut off all contact with my family, since the only emotion I harbor now is depression. I write this letter to you with that same emotion. We both know that there will never be a solution to my probleMs. With the overwhelming risk of ectasia on my already thinned and weakened corneas, combined with my large pupil size, I will never be a candidate for further surgery. I am forever a prisoner within my body. I have no employment, nor can I maintain employment. I rarely Drive, read, write, or do any of the other things I once loved. Having lasik surgery has been the worse mistake of my life. It has literally cost me my life. I have cried every day for over the past 36 months. I have tried several antI depressants without any success since all of these cause mydriasis, making my glare, starbursts, and double vision much, much worse. My life is ruined; unfortunately I am not the only one paying the price. My mother is ill and now her life is ruined. These years were supposed to be the best of my life. I was 20 at the time of the surgery, I wanted to see the world independently and live free. I wanted to be a normal young man. However, I made the mistake of believing and trusting what a Dr and his well trained staff told me. I believed a Dr who took an oath to do no harm. Even though I signed the consent form, as another lasik victim say ""the consent form does not give the Dr the right to do surgery on someone who should not have the procedure."" the consent form you sign has you taking all the risks and the Dr taking none. I thought that is what I was paying the Dr for, his expertise , knowledge and integrity to screen me as to whether I was a good candidate or not. I had a wonderful life and I just now exist from day to day. Before the surgery, I had a huge circle of friends, I no longer have any friends except maybe one and the new friends that I have come to know because they too are lasik casualties.

I thought a poor outcome would mean that I would still need to wear glasses. I now have high order aberrations and a mixed astigmatism in both eyes. I had probleMs right from the onset.

This physician's initial response was that my probleMs could not be fixed with repeated lasik procedures and that the first physician should pay to have them fixed.

If my complications were reported by him would I have been informed? I wish there was a website that dealt with each physician's complication rates.

1033972,2008-04-24,"During the early 2007, I underwent lasik surgery. I wasn't as comfortable as I expected after the first couple of days, but I expected things to pick up. I thought my feelings were usual feelings after having surgery. By the beginning of the 2nd week I woke up and panicked, because I was experiencing extreme pain in my eyes and any light intensified the pain. I contacted the facility where the surgery took place and they asked me to come in. My husband had to Drive me while I wore dark patches purchased at the pharmacy, dark sunglasses and cowered in the corner of the car, because of the intense pain caused by any light getting through. I had to be evaluated in a dark room, because I was unable to open my eyes if the light was on. I was diagnosed with iritis by the surgeon and placed back on steroid Drops. The problem seemed to get better for another week or so and then returned repeatedly. After many trips back to the facility, the suregon expressed that, I had to have had some underlying medical condition prior to the surgery that I was not aware of. One night my husband had to take me to eye emergency room because my eyes were so bad. Eye emergency room who respected and apparently had received training from my surgeon agreed with his diagnosis, and again put me back on the steroid Drops. The surgeon explained that they could not do anything more for me and referred me to my ophthalmologist for blood work and a chest x-ray which all came back fine. Now a little over year later, my vision has started to revert back to its original state, I experience daily bouts of pain shooting behind my eyes, occasional blurred vision - I have to look away and refocus - and no one seeMs to be able to tell me why.",Night Issues; Pain

I have had an adverse event related to my lasik and did not know there was a forum to compile data like mine until now. So I wanted to report it so that the fda could have more complete information on the outcomes of the procedure. In 2006, I had lasik performed on both eyes at a facility. My doctor performed the surgery and both facility and Dr. Said that I was a very good candidate for the surgery. By all reports, the surgery went well. Within a week after surgery, my eyesight was 20/20 and I was very pleased with the results, but after I stopped using the mandatory antibiotic eyedrops, my eyes became severely Dry. I literally would wake up in the middle of the night with my eyeballs stuck to my eyelid and I couldn't open my eyes. It's been a problem ever since and I still have to use restasis 2x per day, which I can't say has helped very much. In addition, my eyesight has deteriorated to 20/50 and I have to wear glasses again. I'm told that it was the way I healed that caused the deterioration in sight.

Preoperative examination revealed severe Dry eye - schirmer's test = 4mm, ou-, which was not made known to the patient. - patient was not a contact lens user. - post-surgical examination by another physician also revealed a history of dermatological rosacea around the eyes, mild blepharitis, and mild meibomian gland dysfunction - mgd -. These conditions and their implications on lasik were not made known to the patient by the surgeon. Pupils were too small - scotopic diameter = 4mm, ou- to obtain accurate wavescans. In order to compensate for small pupils, the surgeon artificially dilated the pupils despite a warning in the visx professional use manual admonishing surgeons not to use dilating agents when performing customvue wavefront lasik with activetrak enabled - do not use pharmacological dilating or constricting agents immediately before surgery with the activetrak system. The surgeon ignored the warning and did not discuss the implications with the patient. Personnel at visx informed the patient that, by straying from proper visx, fda - approved protocol, the surgeon performed an off-label procedure and improperly applied customvue lasik correction to pupils with diameters that were too small for the wavefront scanner to obtain an accurate waveprint. In addition, visx personnel informed the patient that artificially dilating the pupils could have resulted in non-uniform expansion of the pupil diameter, yielding inaccurate data and increasing the potential for treatment decentration.

I made an appointment with the surgeon that performed the procedure, and he did extensive testing and determined that the suction from the apparatus that holds your eye open caused a cataract to form creating the blurred vision. I did not buy that and went to another eye doctor who tested my vision and said everything looked good in regards to the healing process, but that my vision has been over corrected. They gave me a contact to wear and it improved my vision some what. They said there is no sign of a cataract and not to let any one do surgery on my eye. They also said the doctor performing the surgery should have dilated my eyes when I was screened for the surgery. After I requested my files from the office that did the surgery my next visit to them revealed that the cataract had mysteriously disappeared. The surgeon suggested that he could lift the flap on my eye and do some more corrective surgery, but I suggested that we wait to see if it improved with time and he agreed. He finally admitted that my eye was over corrected. He never has offered to give me a contact to correct my sight or suggested anything of the sort. I have another appointment with the doctor that gave me my second opinion but he made it sound like there is nothing that can be done to correct it.

1035054,2008-04-25,"I had lasik surgery in 1999. Since the surgery, I have suffered from moderate daytime halos and significant night-time halos. Furthermore, starting only a few years after my surgery and continuing into recent yrs, I've become so nearsighted that I require glasses which correct the myopia but do not improve the halos. I have used alphagan p for several yrs especially before Driving at night. The alphagan p reduces the halos by about 50% to 75%, but it is only temporary and cannot be used more than a few times a day spread out over several hrs. It is also expensive as it is a patented Drug. I tried generic pilocarpine at one point but it made my vision even worse and significantly irritated my eyes. I've also spent many hundreds of dollars on prosthetic-pupil contact lenses, which I had to order in smaller and smaller pupil sizes to the absolute minimum available. While the smallest-pupil lenses almost completely eliminated the halos, they made my vision dark -because of decreased light getting through-, significantly reduced my peripheral vision, and consistently became foggy and/or blurry soon after inserting them. Before my surgery, I wore disposable contact lenses with no probleMs. Due mostly to the blurriness I incurred and the fact that I couldn't wear the lenses for more than an hr or so at a time -cleaning and reinserting them reduced but did not eliminate the blur - made them impractical. As of now, I wear glasses and use alphagan p when Driving at night. I understand that my condition is not uncommon, and in fact I do not suffer from Dry eye as many lasik pts do. I also understand that these complications were relatively unk back in 1999 -in fact, it took a lot of research, a couple years, and eye exaMs with many ophthalmologists before I was able to get to the root of the problem-. Thus, I am submitting this report merely to augment your data and offer a report of my results with respect to eye Drops and prosthetic-pupil lenses. I would like to get refractive surgery again at some point in the hopes of reducing or eliminating both my halos and nearsightedness; I have been told consistently by ophthalmologists that I have enough cornea left and would be a good candidate for it. I understand that wavefront technology is a step in the right direction but still offers a high level of risk that my eyesight will not improve significantly. Thus, I am very interested in the fda's findings with regard to lasik surgery. Once I feel that the technology has matured sufficiently and that risks of complications have been minimized, I will get surgery -lasik or otherwise- again. Until then, I regret having ever gotten lasik, and my eyesight is problematic in ways that are not easily correctible, I.e. Halos.",Halos; Dryness; Night Issues
1035065,2008-04-25,"I had disastrous lasik performed by Dr in 2007. On the day of surgery, I had second thoughts - the office staff was very pushy, instructing me to take three valiuMs and then decide to have the surgery. How is a person to make a logical decision about an irreversible medical procedure under the influence of powerful Drugs I went ahead with the surgery, and as a result, I face many life-altering complications that I now know are common after lasik. I feel that Dr dean dornic does not throughly pre-screen his pts for Dry eye. I clearly told Dr and his office staff that I was unable to wear contact lenses due to Dry eye, which is a red flag for the development for serious post-lasik Dry eye - yet they told me that I was a good candidate for the surgery. After surgery, I immediately experience overwhelming pain that continues to this day. Lasik surgery involves cutting into the cornea, severing crucial corneal nerves, resulting in chronic nerve and Dry eye pain in many pts. I am currently on 3 medications to handle the pain and anxiety I fell as a result of my lasik disaster with Dr. Dr and his staff were very impatent with me after the surgery, insisting that 'there is no medical reason' for my pain, although there is much peer-reviewed medical literature to support the existence and mechanism of post-lasik eye pain! I have missed countless days of work, my family does not understand what I am going through. I am in constant pain and the meds to control the pain make me groggy. I wand others to know about the comfort and qual of life that I have lost, so that they can make a more informed decision about lasik eye surgery.

1035055,2008-04-25,"In 1999, I had lasik surgery. My outcome has been poor and my quality of vision has been compromised. I wanted lasik because I thought I would have improved vision. I was comfortable wearing glasses, but had some distortions. For example, walking down stairs was difficult because of distortions in the bottom of the lenses. When I decided on lasik, I selected a ""top"" Dr in the field and had the procedure at a top facility. I understood that there was no guarantee of success with lasik. However, I was not told, nor did I appreciate, that the quality of my vision could be compromised. I just thought, at worse, I would continue to need glasses. My vision probleMs -now some 8 yrs later- have not improved. I see double and triple images, especially at night. The quality of my vision deteriorates as soon as I enter into a dark space, such as a metro stop. There are times I need to leave a store because the lighting is so bad that it impacts my vision, often giving me headaches. I had a specialist at work help me organize my office, so that I could see effectively, minimizing glare and taking advantage of light. In fact, I need intense light in order to see well. Driving at night is difficult because of star bursts and halos from oncoming traffic. The first year after lasik, I had to have at least 4-5 prescriptions. I also went for a series of tests and second opinions at an institute. They confirmed that the probleMs I am experiencing are the result of lasik. As I understand it, the surgery introduced some pitting in my cornea that results in the symptoMs I experience. I am just glad that glasses do help some, but the quality of my vision, even with glasses, is not nearly the quality I used to have pre-lasik. I continue to go for tests, monitoring, and evaluations at institute. I am reluctant to go for any add'l lasik procedures because there is a risk that my vision may get worse, or that I will need three pairs of glasses, day, reading and night. Since I can manage with one pair of glasses now, I do not want to take any add'l risk. I appreciate that fda is looking into this issue. While many are satisfied with their lasik outcome, others are not. More important, I believe the risks of lasik are not explained to pts. Many, like me, believed that there was a risk that we would not achieve 20/20 vision, but failed to be told or failed to understand that lasik could have a qualitative negative impact on our vision.

Note my pupil was left enlarged after a concussion, and hematoma resulting from a car accident in 1985. I had put off lasik for yrs in fear that the pupil dilation might prevent me from being eligible for lasik. Dr immediately responded telling me that the enlarged pupil wouldn't be a problem. Not much thought went into the response, but I assumed she knew what she was talking about as a doctor at tlc. I went ahead with the surgery on original date, performed by another Dr. I knew something was wrong immediately after waking up from my post-operative nap that evening. My vision was horrible.

It is now over a yr later. The doctors have told me they can't fix my left. Also, my vision in that eye is no longer correctible since I had the lasik. I've been told I have to wait for topographic-guided ablation to be fda-approved to have my eyes fixed. Then I was told I could have the surgery in another country. Then I was told I am waiting for an even newer technology called ivis, still not available even in another country. I've seen several specialists.

Vision was blurry in both eyes, but this was reported as ""normal."" at one year post op, I was being treated for epithelial probleMs on left eye with a bandage contact lens. After a few days of wearing the lens, I developed a corneal ulcer in that eye. My eye was swollen shut, oozing blood and pus. I had to go on a regimen of hourly antibiotic and steroid eyedrops. I had to do this for each hour the first 24 hours. Then it was every 2 hours for a couple of days and then on to 3 hours dosage and tapering off. I had to use one week sick time at work, because I was unpresentable and couldn't see out of this eye most of that week. I also couldn't stay awake all night and then come to work and continue Drops hourly. The left eye had ghosting -double vision-. Both eyes had flare/glare from lights. Headlights, lights in the room, street lights, street signs etc. It became impossible to Drive at night because of all the ""extra distractions"" resulting from the surgery. I had trigeminal neuralgia from the lasik surgery and the Dry eyes exacerbated this problem. The pain is in the upper left quadrant of my face, around the left eye. It remained after 8+ years. About a month after the surgery, my eyes began to burn and hurt. This was explained to me as Dryness. This Dryness went on and continues to this day.

Further, post-surgery, I was advised ""oh by the way"", I would now suffer with ""Dry eye"" for ever, which would require continuous application of eye Drops and lifetime usage of restasis. My surgery should never have been done. My close vision improved marginally.

1036150,2008-04-29,"I had lasik performed in late 2006 to correct my nearsighted. I was prescreened and told that I was a great candidate, with normal tests and tear production. The consent form had one line regarding Dry eyes, and referred to patients that wear eye contacts and if they had Dry eyes, they may have more of a problem after surgery. The consent form did not describe how Dry eyes feel, etc. I did not wear contacts because they were uncomfortable in one eye, but when I talked to my surgeon about it, he said that my eyes were not Dry. My lasik results were 20/20 vision, but have also resulted in Dry eyes that have not alleviated over the two years. I have had eye infections due to Dry eye and now have blepharitis and low tear production. I am very uncomfortable and constantly think about and am bothered by my eye discomfort. I have routine eye visits for this complication about every 3 to 4 months. I understood the risks of other major complications such as wrinklings, halos, etc and the probabilities of such risks -about 7% according to my surgeon. However, I would not have had this operation if I had known what Dry eye was and how it felt like - it may have prompted me to know that I did have a Dry eye symptom when I wore contacts, and more importantly how common it is amongst lasik patients I have seen studies that indicate as much as a quarter and perhaps more of lasik patients have permanent Dry eye. In my opinion, Dry eyes are not a minor complication, but a major one that has changed how I behave on a day-to-day basis. It can be very painful, and I do get depressed thinking that I have to live with this for the rest of my life. It truly needs to be addressed and evaluated because Dry eye complications is a significantly occurring complication amongst lasik recipients. When I saw that the fda was reviewing lasik but only rec'd 140 complaints, I knew that I needed to speak up about this but did not know how until now. Patients need much better screening for Dry eye complications. I believe that if I was better screened, I would have been better informed regarding my Dry eye risks and possibly considered not a good candidate for lasik. Additionally, the lasik community needs to change their screening practices to identify potential patients who are susceptible to Dry eye complications, and furthermore consider Dry eye as a major and debilitating complication, not a minor one.

1036136,2008-04-30,"I was born a -7.00 myope. I cannot remember a time in my life when I did not wear glasses. Glasses were as much as part of me as my hair color. In march 05, I walked into my eye surgeon's office with the Dream of not having to wear glasses ever again. After all, my sister and brother both had lasik with great results. I elected to have an epI-lasik procedure confident with the knowledge it was the conservative ""safe"" route to take. I knew something was wrong within days after the surgery. At first, my fear focused on being overcorrected. After a lifetime as a myope, I hated being farsighted. I was terrified. I didn't sleep for weeks. I didn't eat. I lost 20 pounds. I did not feel comfortable in my own skin. Things only got worse. My left eye stabilized at +1.00 while my right eye went into a tailspin. When the dust settled three months post op, my right eye was +1.75. As it turns out, the hyperopia was not the worst symptom. Since, I had my surgery in the spring, the long periods of sunlight masked the glare, halos and starbursts that would be the focus of my most intense fears. I soon discovered that stop lights at night were an unrecognizable mess of glare, led lights created huge streaks of light, etc. My fear now became panic. I saw several ""specialists"" during this period. I was desperately seeking answers/solutions. To a person, they told me that my situation was not that dire and that additional surgery would most likely fix all of my symptoMs. In 2005, my surgeon had an idea: perform an epithelium debridement on my right eye. He believed that irregular epithelium healing was the cause of much of my hyperopia. He told me it was a safe procedure and healing would only be a few weeks. No such luck. Shortly after the surgery, I developed severe haze in the right eye that did not diminish with time. My apprehension was now a total obsession. I saw another specialist, a world class surgeon in l.a. Dr -at the suggestion of my original surgeon-. Again, I was told not to worry. He suggested that I have the haze scrapped, allow the eye to heal, then have another laser surgery performed. I had the haze scrapped from my eye in 2006. This further flattened my right eye and left me at +3.00. The real problem was that the +3.00 did not tell the whole story. Contacts and/or glasses no longer corrected my right eye. Night vision was an even bigger mess. While my right eye healed from the haze scraping, I had a second surgery -prk- performed on my left eye in 2006. I so wanted the hell to be over. After a couple months, the left eye healed okay; however, the glare, starbursts and halos were still extremely prominent. In 2006, I flew to vancouver to see another world class eye surgeon -Dr - at the suggestion of my original surgeon- regarding my right eye. Due to the fda approval process, foreign eye surgeons have several tools available that american surgeons do not. After a short consultation, I consented to have a topographic guided prk procedure performed on my right eye. Sixteen months of hell for me and my family; untold thousands of dollars on surgery, optometrists, glasses, and contact lenses and I still had terrible vision. My left eye was near plano but my right eye was now -2.50. I wanted to celebrate my left eye but the glare, starbursts, and halos were ruining my life. I avoided the night like the plague. I hit rock bottom after trying rgp lenses with a local optometrist. The local optometrist I saw did not have much experience fitting post refractive patients. The lenses did not mitigate the glare and were incredibly uncomfortable. I then saw a optometrist who specializes in fitting post refractive patients with contact lens. The first lens iteration, using a macrolens, fixed my eye chart vision but did not mitigate the glare. Not to worry, a larger optical zone might be necessary. The next day, the second iteration lenses, again the macrolens -14mm diameter lens with a 10mm optic zone-, arrived. I could see 20/15 and the glare was significantly reduced. In addition, the lenses were comfortable. In fact, the lenses were no less comfortable than the soft silicon hydrogel lenses I was previously wearing. I immediately wore the lenses for a full day. Another iteration was necessary to find the ""perfect"" fit, but I now had hope that I could live a normal life. I wish this story had a perfect ending; however, it does not. I still see excessive amounts of glare. It can be mentally debilitating. Streaks of light shoot out from bright sources -I.e. Overhead track lights, street lights, etc. - like dancing spikes of light every time I blink or move my eyes. No one seeMs to understand why. It is not a function of the contact lenses. Sometimes I can mentally erase these streaks and sometimes I cannot. I also still see large starbursts -with the contact lenses-. Green stop lights at night are the worst. I hold out hope that my remaining symptoMs will mitigate over time or there is some kind of alternative. I continue searching for the perfect solution. A bit of an epilogue to this story is that contact lenses continue to get better, and Dr greg gemoules, dallas texas, has led the effort in this regard. The contact lenses that currently help are custom manufactured using data obtained from a zeiss visante oct. The lenses are very large 15mm with a huge 10mm optic zone.",Halos; Starbursts; Glares; Night Issues

1037838,2008-05-01,"I had lasik surgery on both eyes, to correct nearsightedness. Since the surgery, I experience visual distortions, such as halos, starbursting, glare, difficulty seeing clearly in most lighting-situations, except outdoors during the daytime (natural sunlight). There is also some Dry eye, which was present, to a lesser degree, before the surgery. After the surgery, other optometrists (not the doctors involved in the surgery) told me that I should never have been considered as a candidate for lasik, due to my large pupils and existing Dry eyes. My tbu is somewhere around 3-4; prior to the surgery, I was having trouble wearing contact lenses because of this Dryness; I was told that lasik could help, as I would not need cls after the surgery. Ironically, the only thing that restores part of my night vision is rigid gas permeable lenses, which have to be fit by an expert. They are extremely difficult to tolerate and expensive. It is also extremely difficult to find a doctor with the experience for fitting contact lenses for these types of probleMs. It is also possible that equipment -malfunction may have occurred, as well. I have decentered ablations. In any case, my large 8mm pupils/Dry eyes practically guaranteed that I would have the above mentioned aberrations. Any possible contraindications were downplayed. Pre-op, I had a definite intolerance to rgps -and even soft lenses. Lasik induces tear-film probleMs that exacerbate contact-lens intolerance. After years of struggling with soft contact lenses, I would never have risked being rendered dependent on a type of lens that I myself knew -and was known by doctors- that I was unable to wear. I believe that the initial fda study suffered from ""under-reporting"". That is, most people do not even know of this form. I, myself, only happened upon it by mere chance. I guarantee that there are far more than the ""140"" people suffering from life-changing lasik-induced probleMs. Again, I'm not sure what is being looked for.

1037597,2008-05-01,"In 2000, I was diagnosed as having a narrowing of a canal - I think it was called - in my eyes that might cause glaucoma in the event of severe change in blood pressure. Laser surgery to correct the defect was recommended. Unfortunately, I was unable to keep the follow-up monitoring appointment with the laser surgeon. Since then, and most noticeably, when I became perI-menopausal, I have begun to experience blurring/double vision, and halos. It is more severe when my eyes are strained, especially, after using the computer for a long period. I had attributed the symptoMs to deterioration due to age, but today I heard a program on national public radio which described exactly the same symptoMs from lasik surgery in a small percentage of pt's. I do not have my records available, but could retrieve more accurate info if it would be helpful. Please let me know.",Halos
1037803,2008-05-01,"I had lasik and it resulted in permanent halos, loss of night vision, and Dry-eye. The Dry-eye is mild and has improved with time, but has continued. The halos and night vision are severe. I have larger than average pupils, and I've been told that the problem is that they expand to be larger than the surgical scar, which causes light to refract and cause a halo or aura around lights or light-colored objects in dim light. Dim light basically means anything less than very bright sunlight. I used to have unusually good night vision, and it's far more limited now, that's what I regret the most. My measured vision regressed after the fact, but I expected that - it was very bad before. I still wear glasses, but at a much lesser prescription. I don't count that as an adverse reaction, but I do think that many people don't realize that if you have terrible vision to begin with you are less likely to get perfect vision from the surgery. I did know that and accepted it. Due to the halos, I could not Drive at night for years, and I only risk it now because I've been able to get much better antI-glare for my glasses that helps a lot. The major problem that I have now is that I can't read street signs until I'm very close because the white wording blurs due to halos. Also, pupils shrink as you age, so that may have helped. My doctor spent a lot of time with me and was very thorough before and after - I don't blame him for this problem. I was warned that I had a higher likelihood than normal to get the long-term halo effects, but was also told it was unlikely. I did not know exactly what the halos wee, and I do not think people realized how likely they were with my type of eye structure at the time. The halo effect and loss of night vision have had a permanent adverse effect on my life and ability to function. I think people should be warned about how troublesome this is, and that there should possibly be stricter guidelines against people with large pupils having this surgery, at least until they figure out how to lessen the chances of this happening. Maybe some sort of Drawing or film could be made showing what they might end up seeing at night to explain what the halos are could help. My doctor was very careful about measuring how thick my corneas were before agreeing to do the surgery - maybe pupil size should be an add'l first check.

1037644,2008-05-01,"Pt had lasik surgery at facility by Dr. In 1999, on his left eye. Subsequent to, and as a direct result, of this surgery the pt acquired chronic impaired night vision - starburst, glare, and halos. Additionally, he has Dramatically reduced contrast sensitivity. This was confirmed on a contrast sensitivity test in 2000, where his left eye scored 50% but his right eye - unoperated - 100%. Because of the devastating negative outcome the patient decided against the planned lasik surgery on the right eye. The disparity in the visual acuity of his eyes resulted in a secondary condition of anisometropia and he is now dependent upon a contact lens in his unaltered right eye as his only means of balanced, corrected vision. As to a cause of the negative outcome it became clear to the patient after second and third medical opinions that his left pupil size was large and made him a poor candidate for lasik - 6mm ablation zone and patient has 8mm to 9mm pupils on low light. Facility incorrectly assessed his pupil size at 6mm in low light. The patient recalls that his screening by a technician at facility was done only using a card with varying sizes of black circles. He now has learned this to be the most primitive of techniques in assessing pupil size and there is also no standard for pupil measurement - whether devices or techniques - in the u.s. He is also dismayed that Dr. Did not independently verify his pupil size at any point prior to surgery. There is apparently no surgical recourse for this outcome of poor night vision, anisometropia and loss of contrast sensitivity, none of which were disclosed in his consent form for the off label use of the summit laser for lasik.

I only did so after being assured, by the physician hiMself, that I was an excellent candidate and would love the results and that the possibility of complications were extremely small. I was never told about Dry eyes, complications of night vision, possibility of ectasia, etc. Needless to say, I feel as though, I was swindled by a very good salesman. I was a -3 to begin with and regressed to a -1 following the surgery. I still struggle with Dry eyes today, over three years following the surgery. I have difficulty Driving at night because of the halo effect of oncoming traffic lights. I would urge the fda, to put some type of procedure in place that would let the general public know that some individuals wished they never had the surgery. Perhaps have them watch a mandatory dvd of people who have had bad experiences. I think this should be part of the sales pitch that the doctors make when trying to get patients to come to their establishment for the procedure.

1037659,2008-05-01,"In 2003, I underwent bilateral lasik using the visx customvue platform following the screening by and recommendation of a Dr of eye center. I was informed that I was an excellent candidate for the procedure and inquiries as to whether pupil size and/or size of correction were potential adverse considerations in the determination of my candidacy, such concerns were very cursorily and flippantly dismissed and the customvue technology was purported to eliminate the adverse consequences experienced by some, prior lasik procedures - with advertisements showing pictures of rep visual outcomes with and without customvue technology. The result of the procedure was the immediate inducement of visual smearing - far worse than anything ever seen in even the poor outcome representations that customvue was to render obsolete - upon expansion of pupils in indoor, dim lighting and nighttime settings, a directional smearing and loss of contrast sensitivity due to the cumulative effects of such smearing. In inquiries immediately following the surgery, Dr alleged that the visual smearing - very precisely and accurately described by me - could potentially be the result of brain / optic nerve issues that would necessitate visiting a neuroophthalmologist that could potentially be extremely serious - and, of course, of no relation to lasik. I visited a neuroophthalmologist who concluded the results to be caused by lasik and that I had extremely Dry-eyes. Dr would later cite psychological probleMs and the need to seek therapy-. The cause of the induced probleMs were very clear and obvious to those with even a casual understanding of the subject - and even the tiniest degree of honesty, integrity or compassion for human beings-: the ablations were systematically decentered superiorally which, when coupled with inadequacy of optic zone for size of pupils (note: pupils were noted at ""16.0mm"" with lights off by pre-qualifying examiner - Dr of another place- despite being extremely large even to the casual observer - registering at 8.0mm by physicians in subsequent visitations; as such, qualifying/referring practitioner likely set the pupil size equal to the size of the treatment zone so as to conclude one to be a good candidate, not because it is actually the size of my pupils and amount of tissue removed, accounted for all of the visual probleMs experienced. This is very clearly evidenced by all topographies; this was not the product a biomechanical instability of the flap manifesting itself as an undesirable healing pattern but by an incorrect alignment as achieved by the laser platform and the practicing physician, which is supported by artemis scans and the immediacy of symptomatic descriptions. The flagrant lies following the procedure caused tremendous mental/psychological distress - I am not a complete idiot, so I had a sense that I was being lied to by first Dr and assorted referring physicians concerning the cause and prognoses of the devastating and life-altering results - due to the fact that I soon realized I could not obtain the truth concerning my current condition from anyone in the industry - I visited many throughout the country - due to their interests in protecting their colleagues and their profession. What I encountered during my efforts to work with the medical community - the willingness to do and perpetuate harm at any cost for - albeit tremendous - personal gain; greed manifested by a desire to perpetuate a practice at any cost and any level of dishonesty and obfuscation in the midst of those literally crying for help or at least acknowledgement of probleMs induced if help was not possible - beyond any description - was something I will never forget. I obtained confirmation of the truth of what was done to me only upon traveling overseas - to london, england - a tremendously painful and difficult trip given the Dry-eye and visual disruptions - apparently severing the code of silence on my travel across the pond. Perhaps even more importantly, the lies perpetuated by the lasik community during my inquiries immediately following the surgery very likely caused a further life-long devastating condition: Dry-eye. First Dr prescribed alphagan p approx 10 days post-op - without the disclosure of its potentially devastating Dry-eye effects if applied to recently ablated eyes during a crucial time/window when corneal nerve regeneration is of utmost importance - due to the devastating visual effects - and election not to disclose the reason for the directional smearing and consequent ineffectiveness and inadvisability of pupil-constricting medication as a post-op, long-term solution given the cause-; he then prescribed c-pilocarpine due to lack of efficacy. Dr holzman then prescribed - within approx 2 months of the surgery - corneal gas permeable lenses; the practitioner to whom he referred me had no experience fitting such lenses in post-lasik cases. The pain of lens wear was truly excruciating. All of these courses of actions prescribed likely retarded corneal nerve regeneration during the time period in which such regeneration is crucial, resulting in the -extreme, irreversible- symptomatic onset of Dry-eye pain, which progressively worsened to a constant and debilitating state.",Ablations; Dryness; Flap Issues; Night Issues; Pain

I am asking the fda to intervene and evaluate the risks of laser for prevention of angle closure in narrow angle pt's. I know of many people with complications after this surgery and I am searching to find more. All the people I know have had similar pre-operative situations ie: not informed of complications, asymptomatic, normal iop, normal vision and varying degrees of sight destruction post operatively with loss of quality of life. I entered the ophthalmologist office because my optometrist was having difficulty getting my right eye to focus when reading with new prescription progressive lenses for extended periods of time, previous to this change in prescription I wore only reading glasses, and he noted I had a iop of 20. Please note my iop had been stable at 20 for 5 years and he expressed no concern about my angles, grade 3. Visual activity without corrective lenses was 20/25. I experienced pain and severe changes in my vision immediately. They include: white line, loss of visual acuity, now 20/70, loss of contrast vision with blur, pain inside eyeballs that is a intense throbbing, burning pain, pain in and around eye orbits with movement of eyes that extends into cheek area, sticky Drainage, strange flashes of light with eyes open and closed, glare, involuntary sensation of eyeball ""shaking"".

Since I was approximately the 40th person to have lasik surgery performed by this doctor and on the same machine as all previous patients, it may not have been working correctly. What ultimately happened was that my right eye was 'corrected' to 20/20 vision, my left eye, however, was 'over-corrected'. Instead now of being near-sighted in my left eye, following the procedure, I was now far-sighted to approximately 20/40. This has made for difficulty in focus, especially at night. I generally see a double image of any light at night, stars, the moon, headlights, street lights, etc. All have a slightly off-set double image which is irritating to say the least. The surgery also decreased my night vision ability with the common side effect of 'starbursts' around any light source; headlights, street lights, traffic signals, etc. Over the years, the night vision has improved slightly as my eyes have healed. The double-vision though, has remained the same. When I told the lasik surgery clinic that I was having the double vision probleMs, they examined my eyes. They told me that the damage was not bad enough for it to warrant a corrective surgery and that I would have to live with the problem. All the experience was disappointing and painful.

My prescription was -9.5 in my right eye and -9.0 in my left eye. I started wearing glassed in approx. 5th grade, and contacts in 6th grade. I was very athletic my whole life and I hated to wear glasses, and so wore contacts all the time except for right before bedtime when I removed my contacts to go to bed -and I needed to wear my glasses literally, to find my way to the bed, the bathroom, etc. I was unable to see the clock by my bedside, unable to see a person's facial features a foot in front of me. I was very comfortable wearing contacts and they never ever bothered me one bit -beside the fact that you had to put them in and take them out everyday, buy solution, etc. So that is the background. I decided to get lasik. My father had successful rk in the late 1990's. Two of my sisters and a brother had successful lasik in the year or two prior to my lasik. I decided, why not me? It worked for them. I come from a family of 11 and we are practically all near-sighted to some degree, pretty severely in 4 or 5 of us. Upon my consult w/ the lasik doctor, he tested my cornea and said that it was probably thick enough to do the surgery, but wasn't sure it would be 100% successful, due to my severe prescription. I asked him if an unsuccessful surgery meant that I would not be able to see 20/20, but no worse off than my current condition at the time. He agreed and said, I would be no worse off. I verified that if the surgery did not work, I would still be able to wear contacts as opposed to glasses. He assured me I would. So basically, I figured, if the surgery was unsuccessful, all I would lose -or whatever it was at the time- and be right back to square one. Better than losing my eyesight. The surgery happened, and I definitely saw some improvement, I.e. I didn't have to wear my glasses/contacts to walk around the house or see the clock. However, I would consider the surgery unsuccessful. My night-vision was, and still is awful. And Driving at night in the rain, forget it! I couldn't see the lines on the road, had a very severe depth perception problem, as in how close or far away is that car in front of me?, and the headlights on cars coming toward me were like big huge starbursts. I could not tell the difference sometimes between oncoming car headlights, street lights from above, and tail lights - at least these are red, so that clued me in. They all just looked like huge, huge circles of light. I had about 4 enhancements on my right eye in the next two years approx., but to no avail. I actually developed astigmatism, my regular eye doctor told me, which I had not had previous to lasik. To make a long story short, I wear a contact in one eye, that eye is very Dry, especially in air conditioning or direct heat - aka blowing from a car heater, and I don't see nearly as good as I did with my contacts pre-lasik. I wish I never would have gotten the surgery. I advise anyone w/ sight as bad as mine not to get lasik. Now, the shape of my eye -cornea- has changed so much from all of the enhancements that no contact will fit comfortably on my eye. I've tried about 5 or 6 different makes and models, even gave up at one point and wore glasses. I was furious and very sad, broke down in tears on many occasions. My eye doctor found this contact that works the best for me for now. As I said my eye is Dry, but I will continue to wear it until I cannot stand it. There may come a time when glasses will outweigh Dry eye. As for my left eye, I do not wear a contact. However, it is not 20/20. Can get along with it with the help of my contact-dependent right eye. I think it is actually far-sighted now -caused by the surgery. So there is really nothing I can do about that eye. Dates of use: 2001 - 2008. Diagnosis or reasons for use: near-sightedness.",Starbursts; Dryness; Night Issues; Astigmatism

I require reading glasses for close which I understand is a natural aging result that can not be stopped. But now my distance vision is actually getting worse.

Also, at times in the day I see some dark flutters at the top of my vision. When I told the doctor about it, but he said the flutters aren't related to the lasik, but I had never experienced this before. Also, he said the glare may be caused by the fact that one eye is corrected for close vision, and the other is corrected for distance. I had consented to this.

1037817,2008-05-01,"I had lasik laser eye surgery. When the procedure was being done, the flap that was cut on my left eye was very thin. Then, the computer on the laser machine crashed. It took a few minutes to re-boot. While re-booting, the doctor tried to keep my eye saturated with fluids. However, when the very thin flap was replaced, it had a wrinkle in it. The wrinkle caused blurry vision in a starry pattern. I had a second surgery done to smooth out the wrinkle, and it helped, but the vision in that eye will always be a bit blurry. Also, an overall consequence of lasik that I was not adequately informed of before the surgery is Dry eyes. It is especially difficult overnight, and especially if I've had a alcohol to Drink before going to bed. I can detect a Drying of eyes after just one glass of wine. Sometimes my eyes get so Dry overnight that I wake up with incredible stinging eyes in the middle of the night.

I had 20/15 vision in both eyes shortly after the procedure, but now it is 20/60 in my left eye and 20/20 in my right. I see halos around lights at night, more so in my left than right. I wear prescription glasses to use computers or to see fine print, and to help with night vision while Driving. I went to an eye-doctor friend who put this plastic, hand-held piece of plastic over my left eye and it cleared my vision significantly. I don't know the name of the plastic but it has beveled pattern to it that sort of straightens out how the light enters the eye. Even with glasses, my eyesight is not near what it was back in 2001.

1037599,2008-05-01,"Lasik surgery to both eyes. Procedure was to create ""mono-vison"" with left eye for distance vision, and right eye for near vision. Initial surgery failed as right eye healed with a focal distance of approx 8 inches instead of the desired 24 inches. After three months for the initial surgery to heal, a second procedure was performed to correct the right eye. This procedure also failed, as the right eye now had a focal distance, approx 30 inches. The surgery center suggested solution was to alter the left eye, which had headed properly following the first procedure. I declined, not wanting to risk my vision any further. The initial assessment was performed by a technician and an optometrist. I did not see the surgeon until just minutes before the procedure. To this day I require eye Drops several times a day - a possibility that was not impressed upon me prior to the surgery. After 21 months, I gave up squinting in order to read and returned to glasses. I now wear trI-focals. I believe the decline of my near vision, which was fine before the surgery, was hastened by the surgery. I would not recommend this surgery to anyone. Dates of use: 1.

It has now been three weeks since surgery, and there is no improvement with the starbursting. My left eye still sees normally at night when I wear my contact. My right eye vision has been corrected, but I notice smaller starbursts during the day and big starbursts at night. I was planning to have the left eye done as well, but I don't want to do it until I know my right eye night vision improves.

1037788,2008-05-01,"Re: lasik surgery - adverse outcome. I understand the fda is investigating lasik surgery and is soliciting feedback from consumers who have had poor outcomes. I am reporting an adverse result. Here's my story: had the procedure done in 1999. The procedure was a failure from day one. I never fully corrected my vision and has deteriorated ever since. Initially after the procedure, I got by without glasses or contacts, but it was a real struggle to see. I then had to very regrettably go back to contacts, but had to wear soft ""toric"" lenses which I had never had to wear before. I had some astigmatism pre-op but, the lasik made it even worse. In the past two yrs, I have become fully contact lens intolerant. They do not correct my vision, they actually horribly distort it. I have tried many different types, including ""hybrid"" lenses for post surgical patients. I must now wear glasses 100% to see. My corneas are severely distorted and I have a bulging thin spot at the bottom which precludes any further procedures. I am not correctable to 20/20 with glasses, so bottom line, lasik has been an absolute disaster for me. I have gone for multiple opinions and have been diagnosed as having lasik ectasia, keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, pmd, and ""we don't know why it didn't work."" I was told that I should never have had the surgery looking at my pre-op topographies today, but I had gone for 3 evals before doing the surgery and no one had expressed any concerns or that I wasn't a ""candidate."" so on top of having an extremely poor outcome, my other complaints are Dry eye, and lots of junk in my vision, floaters and flashes. It has also been pretty devastating emotionally to hear all the glowing lasik stories, while I now have fewer corrective options than I did before the surgery, my bcva isn't event 20/20. There are also the time and personal expense issues of flying to see specialists, going to multiple appointments and the absurdly expensive treatments, intacs, c3r and special lenses that don't even work.",Dryness; Astigmatism; Ectasia; Flashes

I thought I was informed of all the risks, but I think things were not known at the time. While I had 20/20 vision for several years and the initial results were very Dramatic, my eyesight has worsened over time. I began wearing slightly corrective glasses in 2002. Now I wear glasses most of the time. It isn't absolutely necessary in the daytime, but since my vision is not perfect, so it helps me, esp. With my weaker eye. It went back to being the weaker eye. More seriously is the fact that my night vision is seriously impaired. I cannot Drive without my glasses at night. I do fine in the city where there is a lot of light at night. And, rarely found myself Driving in darker places. But, I discovered a couple of years ago that I cannot Drive in areas where it is darker and single lights serve the purpose of lighting.

He performed too many surgeries on patients during too short of time that day - the nurse said it was the most they had ever scheduled, 21-, thus rushing and not cleaning up the epithelium under my lenses. As a result, the epithelium grew lifting the lenses and distorting the eye sight. They also contaminated the right eye with a foreign contaminate. I suspect the right eye sight was worse because the assistant failed to keep it adequately wet during the procedure. I could smell and hear the burning of the tissue and eventually the surgeon told him to apply more liquid during the initial surgery. I called them the next day and said that something was wrong because I couldn't see much out of my right eye, and my sight in the left eye which had been ideal had now become blurry. They tried to convince me that nothing was wrong and they attempted to make me feel as if I was being unreasonable. After arguing with the center's optometrist for one month, they finally agreed to re-do the right eye after 3 months from the original surgery. Unfortunately, when they performed the second surgery, they over-corrected the sight and now it is impossible for me to read with that eye, and is sometimes blurry at a distance. Although the left eye continues to be somewhat blurry, I am afraid to have them re-do it for fear they completely screw-up the sight in it as well. They also left a great deal of cells that float around in both eyes, the right having more than the left which is extremely irritating. Furthermore, I have severe halos in both eyes at night. Now I find it difficult to read - they said they would sell me reading glasses, one eye is blurry, the other eye was over-corrected. I can't Drive at night without putting Drops in my eyes, and suffer from eye strain -pain- and headaches. What can I do now that my eye sight is ruined? They never warned me about any of this! The fda should have been proactive at the inception of the lasik surgical procedure rather than reactive, which is always the norm. Now that the damage has been done to thousands of people why is the fda not allowing the victiMs to receive compensation from the doctors? An insurance fund should be set up. It is virtually impossible to sue the surgeons since no other surgeon will testify against their own, and patients are required to sign their life away to have the procedure performed without honestly knowing the risks.

I'm trying to be patient, but I'm still waiting. I have severe myopia, and the surgery did seem to improve my vision greatly in that regard. I can read road signs, if the print is large enough, without glasses now, whereas before I would not be able to recognize a person's features if their face was 3 feet away. However, my vision is blurry, and I suspect that is a bit of astigmatism that hopefully can still be corrected if I am allowed to go in for a follow up procedure. The halos around lights at night have subsided but are not totally gone. I am unable to focus a camera perfectly through the viewfinder. I hope that I can have a correction made, but if not I am going to have to ask to get glasses and hope that my vision will be clearer. I did not go into this procedure with unrealistic expectations. At best, I was hoping that I would have incredibly clear vision, like a celebrity in the promotional posters must have, because I know he would not settle for ""close enough."" at worst, I was hoping that at least I could function if I lost my glasses, and this is the case. However, I do feel that people should be very careful about what they think will happen after lasik. So far I have not had any complications other than Dry eyes, but it is still too early to tell about that either. Now that I talk to my friends who raved about the surgery that they had done years ago, I find out that their vision is not perfect either, but they don't seem too concerned about that. People need to know that it is a complex surgery and to get things perfect is not guaranteed. They either need to read the fine print, with their glasses, or the doctors need to be more honest and spend more time with the pt to make sure they understand all of the details. I am in the midst of several follow up exaMs at my optometrist. He has pronounced my vision to be 20/20, although I am telling him that my vision is still blurry. He tells me that the eyes are still healing on the cellular level, and that they are Dry. I am waiting before I can fully evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure, but it has been several months and I still do not have perfect vision.

So during the day and bright light the pupil contracts to a smaller size, and is within the treated area and my vision is o.k. It's not 20/20, but closer to 20/30 or 20/35. However as it gets darker or cloudy, my pupil expands and the outer part of the pupil goes outside of the treated area and my vision gets worse. Then in total darkness at night a larger portion of my pupil is outside of the treated area, causing the halos and star bursts. Sometimes it's so bad that I have to turn on the inside car light to help shrink my pupil and to shrink the star bursts.

Correction to 20/20 in one eye and 20/40 in the other did not work for me. Dr should have tested me with glasses first. So had to have a second procedure within a few months to change the 20/40 eye to 20/20. Double vision in right eye and a huge ""flare"" in that eye as well -- if I looked at a stop light at night, there was huge flare of light running off the top of the round light.

I wore contacts prior to the surgery but my Dr said that because of eye infections, I would go blind if I continued wearing contacts. I decided to get the lasik procedure. I was the 95th person my Dr had performed the surgery in his facility. I was given valium before the surgery which made me jittery and made my palMs sweat - the opposite reaction they were expecting. The surgery went well and the first couple of post-operative visits were fine, just a little blurry. Within a few days, I had a blurry spot where I could not see in my right eye. If I turned my head sometimes I could see fine from that eye. Anyway, after weeks of appointment, steroids and consultations with other physicians, it was determined that I had oil -sweat- under my flap. It eventually cleared up.

I was told that the operative site for the lasik is smaller than the area my eye dilates and that the blurriness comes when my eyes dilate, at night and I'm seeing my old vision on the outside of my pupil. Before my surgery, I wore a -9 in contact lenses. I do see lots better than I did without glasses but the night vision probleMs are permanent, and I usually avoid most night Driving.

These floaters consume most of my waking thoughts. I have researched for hours to find out there is nothing that can be done about them. They have caused me enormous stress and depression. I have a hard time with the thought that I will have to live with these forever. When I had the surgery, there was never any mention of floaters in the papers that I signed. I realize I took a risk having surgery, but is it possible that a study could be done to determine if floaters are indeed caused by lasik?

The other, most debilitating side effect has been reading - books-. It is almost impossible for me to read in fluorescent lighting. This posed a great problem in school.

1037947,2008-05-02,"In 2007, I underwent lasik vision correction surgery. I was screened and declared a perfect candidate for the surgery. The surgery itself went exactly as planned with no ""surgical"" complications. According to the Dr, the healing process also went normal and I was declared to have an excellent outcome due to my low refractive error. However, in spite of this, the results of this surgery were actually disastrous. Although my post-surgical refractive error is quite low, the surgery induced a significant level of higher order aberrations, including a highly abnormal level of spherical aberration and coma due to a correction zone that is much smaller than my scotopic pupil size. I see fine in direct sunlight and natural lighting, but have difficulty seeing clearly under normal levels of indoor or artificial lighting. I can not see clearly in many indoor environments during the day, particularly on overcast days, and I have consistently poor quality of vision indoors in the evenings due to significant loss of contrast sensitivity. I frequently experience halos around indoor lighting. It is also very difficult to Drive at night due to significant starbursting on all light sources, which results in a significant loss of depth perception. I can not enjoy many leisure activities such as watching movies. Watching television with lights on can be quite challenging due to poor quality of the image I see, and going out at night is difficult. None of these vision quality issues can be reliably corrected with glasses or contact lenses, and when dealing with eye Drs, I find that my pupils are now considered to be abnormal and I'm lumped in with individuals who have diseased corneas. Although I did sign an informed consent form, this form was treated as a formality and it was represented to me that with the latest wavefront technology, the types of complications detailed in that consent form were mostly a thing of the past.

My vision was corrected to at least 20/20, but astigmatism remained. Due to the accuracy of the laser, the Dr would not do an enhancement, but would replace lens at cost in my existing frames. As the 'starbursting' was more an annoyance I never proceeded getting glasses. When I went in for my one year check up I was notified that the laser had been upgraded. In 2001, the enhancement cleared up the astigmatism. In 2006, I noticed the astigmatism returning and probably worse than after the original surgery -otherwise my vision is still approx 20/20-. Having relocated several times to other states I have not had an opportunity to see the Dr, who did the surgery to follow up. The degree of astigmatism varies which is likely due to how rested I am.

Soon after starting the new regimin I developed symptoMs of classic adverse reaction. These consisted of itchiness like the sensation of 'ants' crawling on my skin and a tightening in my throat leading to some concern on breathing. When I was 6 or 7 I reacted to penicillin by getting hives on my back unlike this occurrence. As I could not get an appt with the allergist I went to a clinic, where the attending physician told me to stop the medication and throw it out. When I did see the allergist he had me do a 'challenge' for both penicillin and augmentin -for clavic acid- in which both were negative.

I suffer these after effects, but if I had the option to choose the procedure again, I would probably do it. The benefits outweigh the after effects. For others this may not be true. It is an assessment that each individual must make. If I could do anything differently, it would be to interview more facilities/physicians, instead of just going with the one who I thought had the best record.

While my eyesight is good, I developed superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis -slk- and severe Dry eye syndrome. According to webmd, ""it is believed that slk is present secondary to superior bulbar conjunctiva laxity, which induces inflammatory changes from mechanical soft tissue microtrauma."" ophthalmologists treated the slk with Drops and environmental modifications for a full year with no success. I have since reluctantly had additional surgery - conjunctiva resection on both eyes, but am still experiencing probleMs. My ophthalmologists say they cannot begin to treat the Dry eye syndrome until the slk is brought under control. Unfortunately, the lack of an adequate tear film aggravates the slk. I believe this vicious circle was directly caused by lasik surgery. Neither the surgeon nor the surgical center where I rec'd the lasik adequately warned me of the dangers. Although it was not bothering me at the time, they measured my tear production, determined I had Dry eyes prior to surgery and started a course of restasis.

In early october I had gone to a ""free"" seminar to gather info before I saw a Dr. I had pre-existing scar tissue on my left eye but Dr said ""no problem"", and we proceeded with bilateral refractive surgery. I did not have good vision from the start. I was told that ""things have not settled down yet. We can always perform an enhancement."" I struggled with my duties at home and work. In 1993, I went to another city to see another Dr -a referral from Dr(first)-. He performed a prk on my left eye with later plans to surgically improve the right eye. At that time second Dr told me that Dr(first) made the cuts in my eyes too deep and too long. My left eye now had vision worse than pre-prk and was covered with scar tissue from the laser. In 1995, I went on medical leave from my surgical nursing position and had a corneal transplant. During that year, I filed for disability retirement. In 1996, I went to jury trial -case, medical malpractice. I was the victim made to look like a perpetrator. We lost the case and threw ourselves into debt. Dr(first) told me I was a good candidate for refractive surgery, that I would have good results and could throw away my glasses. He never told me there was no turning back from this surgery.

1047150,2008-05-06,"My lasik experience: after initial surgery in 1998, then enhancement in 1999, my vision in both eyes, uncorrected was 20/20. This was truly a miracle for those of us so dependent upon contacts and glasses. I remember disposing of all my old contact lenses and extra cases. No more lens cleaning, scrambling for glasses at night, occasional discomfort etc. This visual quality of life lasted 9 months. Then, gradually the sight in my right eye deteriorated to 20/100 by late 1999. I also noticed declining vision in my left eye, just to a lesser degree. My lasik process from the outset was being handled by both my local od and surgeons from the nearby medical school clinic. Neither could understand this change but both concluded that in early 2000, I should undergo a 2nd enhancement on both eyes. The outcome of this 2nd enhancement made no improvement and further thinned my cornea to less than 250m r and 275m l. Eventually, ectasia or keratectasia became the diagnosis and rgp lenses were prescribed. My average best corrected post lasik vision with a rose k rgp in the left eye is 20/25 and a boston scleral lens in the r is 20/40. Typically, I am able to wear my lenses with reasonable comfort up to 15 hours daily. Unsuccessful results: unsuccessful results as in my situation, tend to lead to various complications such as ectasia or keratectasia, Dry eye probleMs, depth perception difficulties, and in general, intense disappointment. Most likely, the real reason for unsuccessful outcomes in the pre lasik screening and preparation process was not adequate and the surgeon was too aggressive in the degree of correction. Also, as is the case in all vocations, there are some physicians who are simply not qualified. Another contributing factor to complications after lasik surgery can occasionally be the result of obsolete or faulty calibrated equipment. Lastly, is the fact that fundamental mistakes are made even by the most qualified doctors. I believe and again emphasize that if attentive pre lasik screening is adhered to, reasonable margins for error are considered, and detailed checks and balances are built into the lasik process from beginning to end, complications as a result of lasik surgery can be significantly mitigated. When you get to the stage many of us are in, anger, frustration, and major disappointment is natural. We ask; why did this happen? What should I do? What will be the final result, I.e. Will I end up blind? Although still very difficult, I try to objectively negate or offset many of these disappointments and concerns by concentrating first by simply coping but secondly and most importantly, focusing on the prospects that better treatments for ectasia, kerataectasis, and keratoconus are being constantly developed and in the not too distant future, a long-term viable solution will emerge.

The surgeon assured me that although there is no long term guarantee on my vision, he was confident that with my age and healthy eyes I was a perfect candidate for lasik and should not need to worry about this or other issues/side effects.

1040354,2008-05-08,"I received lasik in 2002 on both eyes. Things went well for three years. My vision acuity was 20/20. In 2005, I started to notice blurring in the vision of my right eye. The doctor I was receiving treatment from said that it was nothing and that my vision was the same. A year later, 2006, I started to notice more significant changes in my right eye. My visual acuity was now 20/40 od and 20/30 os. I also complained of blurriness. I decided to receive a retreatment on my right eye, but not on my left. In four months later, I received the retreatment. After the surgery, my visual acuity was 20/25 od. I was complaining of blurring and double and triple vision, especially at night. The doctor's office recommended another retreatment. In approx two months later, I received a second retreatment on my right eye. My visual acuity remained 20/25 in my right eye, but there was still a lot of ghosting and double/triple vision. I decided to leave the doctor's office at this time. In 2007, I went to a local ophthalmologist seeking glasses and contacts to help with my vision. The doctor diagnosed me with keratoectasia. Most likely caused by the lasik. My visual acuity was 20/40 od and 20/25 os. I was fitted with a synergese contact lens. They worked well for a while, but my vision began to fade again, due to the bulging of my corneas. I knew that this would happen due to the nature of the disease. Due to worsening condition, I sought out further care for my eyes. After months of researching, I decided to receive further care. In 2008, my visual acuity was 20/100 od and 20/40 os. The ectasia was progressing fast. In the same month, I received intacs in both eyes. I also received ck - conductive kerotoplasty - in my right eye and c3r - corneal collagen crosslinking with riboflavin - in both eyes. Since then my visual acuity has gotten better. Va od is 20/60 and os is 20/20. My vision is still fluctuating to this date. Thank god for these procedures. I am functioning right now unaided and doing much better. I'm more then certain, based on what I know and has been evaluated by the many doctors that I have seen, that my flap thickness was cut too thick and this is what caused the ectasia. This has effected me greatly. I'm a firefighter and need my vision to work. The nasty part of the disease is that it caused me the inability to function with soft contacts and glasses. This is a problem for someone who is required to respond to an emergency in the middle of the night. I couldn't just place a contact in my eye within seconds of waking up. Hopefully, the treatments and procedures I received the same month, will allow me to function for years to come. So far things have gone well, and I hope that they continue to. I'm very happy to see that the fda is getting involved with the requirements for lasik. Lasik is destroying lives right now. Doctors' careless attitudes are also destroying lives with the use of lasik.

Since lasik surgery, I have been plagued by chronic Dry eye. With sign/symptoMs of constant red eyes, discomfort, and occasional visual blurriness due to the Dryness. I am on restasis, have had punctal plugs, both in the superior and inferior puncta, use gel Drops throughout the day, wear protective glasses at all times, and use a night time ointment every night. I currently have ""smart plugs"" in the inferior puncta. Unfortunately, my smart plug on the right has caused severe inflammation, infection and granuloma formation, which now requires surgery under general anesthesia to remove the plug and place a lacrimal stent that will be removed after six months. It is believed that I had undiagnosed chronic Dry eye and should have never been a safe candidate for lasik surgery. The lasik most likely only exacerbated my original Dry eye problem. Had I been adequately screened, I would have never undergone the surgery. It is the worst decision of my life, a decision I would have never made if I had been appropriately screened and given the correct medical advice. I feel comfortable saying this, because I am also a physician and take patient screening, diagnosis, appropriate treatment very seriously.

1052221,2008-05-25,"In 2001, I had lasik, first on one eye and then on the other eye one week later, at a clinic. I have struggled with Dry eye ever since, ranging from mildly to severely annoying. Despite having tried punctal plugs, daily hot compresses, and doxycycline therapy, my meibomian glands have never returned to normal function. Of course, I have since learned this is considered a 'minor' lasik 'side effect', most likely due to the permanent nerve damage wrought by the microkeratome -hansatome- and excimer laser -visx- devices your agency has approved for medically unnecessary purposes. I observed my first floaters--signs of a posterior vitreous detachment--within weeks of the lasik surgery - reported september 2001. This I have learned is due to the high pressure caused by the suction ring used with the microkeratome, which your agency has approved for medically unnecessary purposes. I noticed double vision symptoMs, especially at night, soon after the surgery. I was relieved in 2002 that I was able to get a prescription that seemed to relieve these symptoMs. However, over the next several years, I went in for several more prescriptions, each proving a bit less satisfactory than the last. Finally, in 2007, I was diagnosed with post-lasik ectasia, as my corneal topographies showed the trademark sign of inferior steepening, which accounted for my increasing cylinder and increasing symptoMs of double/multiple vision. I have thick corneas, had stable refraction for 2 years, and measurements of flap thickness with an artemis device showed no signs of a too-deep flap thickness. In other words, I was a 'perfect' candidate, whose preoperative topography -which showed ~0.5 d of inferior steepening- would probably not be turned away today despite the new 'stricter' guidelines being suggested. The reality of course, is that nobody is a good candidate to have their corneal strength weakened by a third by a microkeratome, for no medically indicated purpose. However, this butchery remains approved by your agency. The reality is that keratoconus remains poorly understood. At this point, I'm still -barely- correctable to 20/20, so by some accounts I'm 'normal', despite the fact that one can see 20/20 -or 20/16- with significant irregular astigmatism that is anything but 'normal'. This has been known in the keratoconus literature for years. Yet your agency continues to employ outdated visual acuity measurements as the 'clinical outcome' measurement for approving devices. This is convenient for the doctors, especially so because '20/20' has been popularly misunderstood as 'perfect' vision, when it is anything but. In the last several years, I have read with interest about 'wavefront-guided' treatments, with an interest in reducing my irregular astigmatism. I have been shocked and appalled to see that devices marketed as being effective in reducing higher-order aberrations have actually shown no data to this effect, whatsoever. In fact, they merely reduce the amount of induced higher-order aberrations. They have reduced hoas in patients with initially high levels, but the reductions have been small. It's shocking that devices known to increase higher-order aberrations / on average/ are approved for general use. Should not people be warned that their hoas--their quality of vision--/ will/ be reduced? -though maybe not enough that they'll notice or care. Now I am considering a topography-guided ablation, as this is the only approach that has some track record of consistently reducing irregular astigmatism and hoas by significant amounts. Indeed, several doctors in another country have now several cases of improving forme fruste keratoconus patients' best-corrected vision. However, your agency has not seen fit to at least give humanitarian approval to the laser refractive surgery devices that /do/ have a record in reducing irregular astigmatism -e.g. The suite from ivis technologies and/or the topography-guided options from wavelight-, which is a legitimate medical purpose for refractive surgery. This of course would not be lasik, but rather surface ablation. It is unclear why lasik remains approved today despite the mounting evidence that surface ablation is much safer biomechanically. So I will have to leave this country, and visit another country instead, to have a chance to improve my vision and likely also do corneal collagen crosslinking, which was kept a well-hidden secret from us patients -frequently along with their ectasia/keratoconus condition itself, as doctors frequently don't diagnose what they can't effectively treat- for many years, by your agency. Ironically, I have been funded. In the past, during my phd work. I work as an optical engineer, developing adaptive laser scanning systeMs for neuroscience research. I've developed a cutting edge system, and might well have moved towards consideration for future funding, including the pioneer award. Of course, now it's difficult to work in the dark, so my scientific career prospects are significantly diminished. I am able to work for now under private funding.

I also lost contrast sensitivity as a result of the procedure. I do not Drive at night unless necessary because the oncoming headlights obscure the road. I did not read and sign a consent form until after they had taken my glasses and given me ativan to calm me for the procedure. During the procedure, Dr had a problem while using the laser on one of my eyes because I could not hold my eye still, apparently, and he kept telling me over and over to hold my eye still.

1055501,2008-05-30,"I had eye surgery, after my eye Dr stated I would never have to wear reading glasses again. It sounded so great not to have to wear reading glasses, 2.0 strength, that I said ""count me in"". He casually mentioned at the end of our conversation that only a small percent of pts experience halos -- I didn't know what he meant -- I thought angelical halos are very small, and only a small percent have probleMs, less than 2%, and he acted like it was no big deal --- that I bought into it. My probleMs started immediately after surgery -- halos around every light, each street light or car light -- over thirty feet in diameter -- multiply that by every street light and each car approaching you. Or in your rearview mirror, plus store lights, traffic lights, etc. It makes night Driving extremely difficult and dangerous, and our planet earth is no longer the same! Day vision is a nightmare. The glare and brightness of my world requires me to wear dark sunglasses every min I am outside, which ""only"" reduces the eye strain. I have to wear sun glasses while working on the computer, day and night, which is required throughout my work day and in the evening for personal use. Additionally, the sun reflects off other cars, metal roofs, and many objects as small as a soda can on the side of the road. These are piercing lights and it is impossible to avoid them while trying to Drive. The lights always have several rings around them, which I assume are from the layers of the lenses --like radio waves. My most recent probleMs are associated with new floaters and lights within my right eye that resemble a strobe light show. When I saw my Dr this week, he dilated my eye and shined bright lights in it -- he just didn't think about the impact on my retina from the brightness of them on my already challenged vision. The lights were painful and even turned green -- I thought I would have to stop the examination. I was unable to see out of that eye due to the residual affects of lights in that eye that lasted until the next day. Diagnosis: improve vision.",Halos; Glares; Night Issues; Pain
1055498,2008-05-30,"I rec'd bilateral lasik with the alcon ladarvision 4000 sys. The treatment was wavefront guided utilizing the custom cornea software. A bd microkeratome with 180 micron head was used for flap creation. The optical zone used was 6.5mm with a 9mm total ablation zone. Preoperatively, I was od: -5.5d and os: -5d with .75d astigmatism. My scotopic pupils were measured at 8.3mm. Ever since surgery, I have suffered from large starbursting and halo under low light conditions and reduced low light contrast sensitivity. The bottom line is that I was not a candidate for refractive surgery in the first place: I was lied to and sold the procedure by my Dr and his staff. The optical zone must be large enough to cover the scotopic pupil for surgery to be allowed, end of story. Why dose the fda continue to allow such dangerous and deceptive practices by refractive surgeons? It should be a contraindication for surgery if the scotopic pupil is larger than the proposed optical zone for the device. These visual disturbances are quite disturbing and dangerous for activities such as night time Driving. They are very bothersome for any activity conducted in low light. Finding things in low light is much more difficult post surgery due to the reduced contrast sensitivity. The most blatant violation was treating me with an insufficient oz size, but other damages have resulted as well. I have corneal irregularities within the oz: central islands, as revealed by corneal topography scans. The alcon sys have been known to cause these complications; as such, they are dangerous devices and should be taken off market until these probleMs can be proven through testing, to be resolved. Another damage I have rec'd is high increase in floaters. These are caused by posterior vitreous detachment. Microkeratome suction rings are dangerous devices that create high intraocular pressures and stresses, causing damage to ocular structures like the vitreous humor and retina. As such, they should not be allowed. There are much safer, reliable surface ablation procedures for refractive surgery that do not involve microkeratomes and flap creation. The lasik flap never heals and remains as a life long interface. This leaves the cornea permanently weakened and vulnerable to trauma and flap dislocation. How does this permanent damage benefit the pt with previously healthy corneas? I was 19 at the time of surgery. The fda approval order for the ladar vision 4000 sys clearly state that this device is only indicated for use in those 21 yrs of age and older. I was not informed of this. In fact, my informed consent was highly insufficient. I was not provided a copy of the pt information handbook for the device, which is required to be given to prospective pts - as specified by the fda approval order and the operator device manual-. The pt info handbook contains studies and clearly outlines complications and their percentage of occurrence and also warns about scotopic pupils larger than the 6.5mm oz. My informed consent contained no info about the risk for surgery due to my large pupils or the risk for vitreous detachment and floaters. The clear differences in safety between lasik, lasek, prk, etc. Were not presented so that I could make an informed choice on the type of procedure to choose. The summary of this complaint is as follows: the optical zone must be at least as large as the scotopic pupil. Surgery conducted outside of this is dangerous and visually damaging to the pt. A clear standard of care needs to be established for pupil size. Alcon devices have been shown to be inferior devices with comparatively high complication rates, particularly relating to central islands. The should be banned, investigated, and corrected before use is allowed in the future. Lasik is a dangerous procedure due to microkeratome flap creation. Surface procedures need to be advocated as safer alternatives. Strict guidelines regarding device use and reporting of complication need to be set and enforced. Success rates need to be based on what the pt deemed a success, not the Dr. The pt is the one who has to live with their vision. Informed consent needs to be far more detailed and standardized for refractive surgery. Dates of use: 2007.

1055489,2008-05-30,"I had lasik performed on both eyes in 2005. My surgery was done by a Dr . I wanted lasik because I was no longer comfortable wearing contact lenses. I was not tested for Dry eye or warned of the link between contact lens intolerance and Dry eye. I was also not warned that a pre-existing Dry eye condition would put me at a higher risk for developing permanent Dry eye after surgery. I was handed my informed consent form with the words ""read this, but don't let it scare you, this stuff never happens."" immediately following my surgery, I began having pain in both eyes due to severe Dry eye. My lasik clinic offered very little help, and when I was able to get visits with my surgeon -instead of the regular post-op care Dr-, he would spend about 2 minutes with me and rush me out the door to perform his next ""assembly line"" lasik procedure. I have seen over 10 doctors, tried most conventional Dry eye treatments, and spent thousands of dollars in the process trying to get relief from Dry eye pain and discomfort. I continue to spend over $100 a month on Drops, gels, and other treatment methods to help with my condition. That said, I am still always uncomfortable and often in pain due to my lasik-induced severe Dry eye. My Dry eye symptoMs have impacted all aspects of my life and affect me every waking hour. The first year after my surgery was complete torture. I suffered from severe depression and panic attacks due to the physical pain and guilt that I felt over having elected to have lasik. I never had a problem with anxiety or depression prior to my lasik outcome. A 15 minute procedure that was supposed to make my life easier, has now greatly decreased my quality of life and has complicated it more than I ever could have imagined. I will face a lifetime of eye pain and probleMs due to my lasik outcome. I cannot express in words the pain and sadness that lasik has caused me and those closest to me. I try to keep hope that someday a new Drug will come out that will help me, but until that day comes, I will continue to battle eye pain and the altered lifestyle that I have been forced to accept under these circuMstances.

1057092,2008-06-02,"This is related to cosmetic eye surgery. I considered lasik for awhile, but was afraid that my eyes were too Dry. I didn't really use any Drops during the day, but it was when I could feel that they were really Dry, that's when I occasionally would use Drops. Finally after 3 years I decided to go see a lasik specialist for advice. Two places that I went to did not event check to see if I had Dry eyes. The doctor just looked at my eyes and said they were fine. I was not satisfied with their answers. I finally decided to go to an eye institute for a screening because I heard a lot of good things about them. Even if they charged a lot more, I was willing to give them a try. On my first appointment, Dr determined that I had Dry eyes, therefore, put me on antibiotics and fish oil. She also suggested prk instead of lasik for me, because there will be less nerve damage to my eyes making it less Dry. I was very happy because this was the first place that I felt cared about my eyes. I was on it for 1 month, when I came back for another check up, the doctor said there was improvement, therefore, I can go ahead with the surgery. Before the doctor decided this, she had her assistant measure the Dryness of my eyes with some kind of camera. They had to take the pictures may times, because my eyes were too Dry,  therefore, the camera could not get a good picture of my eyes. I was a little bit hesitant, because my eyes only felt a little better, but trusted that she knew what she was talking about, since she seemed to care a great deal about my eyes. She asked me to continue the antibiotics and fish oil after surgery, she said it should continue to improve even more. I was very excited to hear that. The doctor that operated on my eyes was another doctor. The next day after surgery, I was required to come back in for a check up. When I did, the assistant mentioned that my file said I got lasik not prk, I was very nervous and confused. I went in thinking and also signed paperwork for prk. Then Dr mathers came in, but he was also confused on what I got done, finally they figured it out by looking at my eyes through a microscope. Prk has a different kind of surgery mark than lasik. I was so scared starting that moment on, I wasn't sure anymore about this place. These were my eyes they were dealing with! Four days later, I came back to get the contacts taken out of my eyes, they didn't even know what doctor I was seeing. Dr mathers was on vacation, therefore, I was to see his assistant doctor. Two different ones came in before they could determine which one was to see me today. I was so angry, another mix up, by now I was really scared and didn't trust this place anymore. When the doctor took out my contacts he accidentally poked my eyes. I was shocked, because I thought he should be good at this by now. From then on all my follow up appointments was with third Dr. He was not very organized, every time he came in the room he would ask me why I was here. He would never remember what he recommended for me from the last time. For example, he asked me to start taking 4 pills of fish oil instead of one, he forgot that. He asked me to continue to take my antibiotics and plus he added restasis eye Drop to my daily routine and he forgot that. I always had to update on what he asked me to do last time. It was horrible. I don't think he even looked at my file before he came in. Well, after surgery, my eyes Dryness level got worse. I was putting in eye Drops every 5 minutes. When I came in to see him, he boosted my fish oil intake and recommended other brands of eye Drops. He also gave in an inflammatory Drop, that helped. I started doing eye Drops every 15 minutes. I was still very frustrated. When I came in to see him, he would tell me my eyes look fine and didn't really do anything else for my Dry eyes except to tell me to continue my antibiotics, fish oil and restasis, even though I kept telling him it has not helped me any. After changing to refresh celluvisc eye Drop I was able to wait every half an hour to put in Drops, that was a relief from every 15 minutes. When I woke up in the morning, my eyes felt like there was sand in it. I could never open them, therefore, I started using a night time ointment. I never had to do this before the surgery. I was very frustrated and angry at the fact that this was not told that my eyes will get this Dry and there's really no improvement and the doctor is doing nothing about it. My contract says that after surgery they will see me for six months to monitor my eyes. Every appointment I had after surgery with him was pointless. He kept telling me my eyes were fine after looking at it through his microscope. My last appointment was at my 6 month post operative exam. They measured the level of Dryness for my eyes again with their special camera, it came out very Dry. I figured since my eyes were still really bad he would continue to see and help me get better. Instead he said that since my eyes were Dry to begin with it was not the surgery that made it worse, I was so angry when I heard this. I hardly used eye Drops before the surgery. Now I am doing it every half an hour and it's not the surgery then what is it? Not only is it annoying to put in eye Drops so often, but it's very expensive. He said he will send all paperwork to my regular doctor so I can continue my treatment there. I feel that this doctor did not really care about me. He just wanted to push me out of the door. I am very unhappy and still doing eye Drops every half an hour after 9 months of surgery. I still have to put thick ointments in my eyes before going to bed otherwise, it would hurt to open them in the morning. I want to let others know, so they won't go to where I went. The eye institue.

In 2006, I underwent lasik vision surgery on both of my eyes at the location captioned above. Following the procedure, vision in both of my eyes was blurred and fuzzy. After continued complaints, eyeglasses were ordered for me in 2007. However, my sole purpose for getting the lasik done was so that I would not be burdened with having to wear eyeglasses! Finally, the lasik vision institute informed me that they would re-do the procedure, but when the day arrived on six months later, after a preliminary visit on six days before, they refused due to cataracts. This was the first time anyone mentioned anything to me about having cataracts. They referred me to another hospital for cataract surgery. The cataract surgery was a success, but I continued to have blurriness in both of my eyes just as I did following the lasik procedure. I notified both the lasik vision institutes of my continued vision probleMs by certified mail on 11/08/07. A Dr from st. Luke's responded and recommended some eye Drops to use. They initially seemed to help. I was advised to use them sparingly and I do, but I find now that they do not seem to help clear up my vision.

1056171,2008-06-03,"I had lasik surgery in another country in 2007. I chose this group because my sister had her eyes done there and was very happy with her results. At that time, I wore glasses for far vision, but I could still read without glasses. I went back for my checkup one day after surgery and then 1-2 week post-op. The one weak checkup was planned a few days early because I was experiencing pain in my left eye. The optometrist said, I had an inflammation in my eye and if it wasn't better in 48 hrs, I should a see a Dr in the states. I decided on my way home to see an ophthalmologist immediately. The ophthalmologist said there was something very wrong and sent immediately to a cornea specialist. He did scrapings and put me on 2 types of Drops. From there it went down hill. After not growing a culture on the first scraping, they kept me on antibiotic and steroid Drops. Two weeks later, and a lot of pain, they did another scraping. This time they found a candida fungus. This meant that the steroids were helping the fungus grow, so I was taken off of the steroids immediately and put on 3 different antibiotic Drops, one of which I had to use every hr, and at night every 3 hrs. One antibiotic was one hundred dollars a bottle, had to be kept cold and expired every 7 days. I had to see the Dr either every day or every other day at first. During this time, I was trying to work but my eye was so painful, it was very difficult. One day my vision got so bad, it felt as though I was looking under water. I reported this to the ophthalmologist immediately and got an emergency appt. They found that the fungus ate a hole in my eye and it was leaking. I was to go home, not pick up anything over 5 lbs, and keep my eye covered while showering. They didn't want me to do anything. At the time of the surgery, I had a full time job and 2 small part time jobs. Now I had to quit one part time job and go on disability from the other jobs. Also, I couldn't be in any light at all, it was unbearably painful. I spent most of my days in the basement or a very dark room. I couldn't watch tv and I most certainly couldn't read. My visits to the Dr were everyday now, even on the weekend, both saturday and sunday. My father had to Drive me to and from the Drs and I had to ride in the car with a coat over my head. There was talk about having to glue my eye, but the Drs decided to wait to see if my eye would seal itself off. It did thank god, but the battle continued. I spent 5 mos on disability. The disability company wanted constant updates about my condition or I wouldn't get a check. During this time, my condition would get slightly better, then go down hill again. It was agonizing 24/7. By this time, I'm taking 4 different Drops and a pill. I had to take 2 a day. This doesn't include all the co-pays, other medical bills, prescription costs and the fact that I'm now earning less than half my normal pay and have to pay for health benefits. My vision was never 20/20 after the lasik surgery and now it would get better then worse. My right eye remained about the same, but again, the best it got was about 20/30 to 20/40. Thank god I had some medical coverage. What I've told you so far is what it cost me financially and physically. Mentally, I was a disaster. I cried most of the time. I lost all self-esteem for many reasons. One, I chose to do this. I felt as though it was partially my fault. Two, my career of 26 yrs was in definite jeopardy. I'm an ultrasonographer. We spent all day in a dark room looking at a computer screen which is mostly black and white and have to measure things in millimeters. I couldn't read anything at this point even with reading glasses. The thought of losing my house was constantly on my mind. I've been a very independent person for a long time. I raised 2 children completely on my own. Now I had college expenses I couldn't pay. I've never had to take a hand out from anyone. Now I had to depend on my elderly parents to do everything for me and I had to constantly fight with the disability company for every dime they sent. I thought that I would have to move in with one of my siblings in order to survive. It was the absolute worse time of my life. The thought of ending it all was not far from my mind. Very slowly I got better, with the best care I could ask for from the corneal specialists, and the kindness of their staff. When I went to my appointments, I was in tears and had to hold an icepack on my left eye most of the time. The staff would keep the lights down in the room, so my eye would not be so painful. In late 2007, I went back to work part-time and eventually full time. I still have trouble with my left eye. I've had 3 different prescriptions. Non of them work well. My left eye has shadow vision, or double vision. There is a scar in it. The ophthalmologist said that might get better, but it constantly feels like there is something in it. Both eyes need correction for both near and far vision. My night vision is terrible because all of the lights smear. I can't even enjoy looking at the moon or stars because it's all a smear. I have an appt tomorrow with lasik md approx one yr after surgery. They have closed the clinic, so now I have to Drive to another city, a two hr plus trip.

Even more severe starbursts at night. Starbursts from cars block my view of the road. I have to use my hand to block the starbursts or I have a square piece of 3x4 inch duct tape on the windshield to block starbursts so I can see the road.

I am still on the medication today. The medication helps some but not completely, I can describe it as only taking the sharp edge of depression away.

1061874,2008-06-13,"In 2003, I underwent a bilateral lasik procedure on my eyes at lasik plus. A Dr performed the procedure. In the mos and yrs that followed I developed worsening vision, starbursts and halos, until the point that images began to double and multiply. I did not know it at the time but have since been evaluated by other Drs and told that I now have a condition called ectasia and it is directly due to having underwent lasik. In 2005, my left eye had gotten so bad that I had to have a cornea transplant. My right eye also has ectasia and will require a transplant as well. For me the ""problem"" and ""user error"" is the fact that I feel lasik plus does not allow for adequate screening, lasik plus advertises as though everyone is a perfect candidate for the procedure. There has been no lasting law to prevent them from continuing explicitly advertise as an equally safe choice as wearing glasses. While it might be safe for some, it is not safe for everyone! Yet the advertising touts the safety and hype. One big operational hazard that allowed the mistake on my eyes to happen was the lack of attn to detail. My chart was not given adequate time for scrutiny or discussion. I was not alerted to the fact that my corneas were thin, or that this was an important variable for a safe procedure. At the time of my procedure, I was crammed into a room with 6 other pts and not given any personal time with the Dr to ask questions. Medical history is a sensitive topic, and one that should not have been discussed hastefully in front of several other pts.

1061336,2008-06-16,"I had disastrous lasik performed in 2007. On the day of surgery, I had second thoughts - the office staff was very pushy, instructing me to take three valiuMs and then decide to have the surgery. How is a person to make a logical decision about an irreversible medical procedure under the influence of powerful Drugs? I went ahead with the surgery, and as a result, I face many life-altering complications that I now know are common after lasik. I feel that Dr does not thoroughly pre-screen his patients for Dry eye. I clearly told Dr and his office staff that I was unable to wear contact lenses due to Dry eye, which is a red flag for the development for serious post-lasik Dry eye - yet they told me that I was a good candidate for the surgery! After surgery, I immediately experienced overwhelming pain that continues to this day. Lasik surgery involves cutting into the cornea, severing crucial corneal nerves, resulting in chronic nerve and Dry eye pain in many patients. I am currently on 3 medications to handle the pain and anxiety I feel as a result of my lasik disaster with Dr dean dornic. Dr and his staff were very impatient with me after the surgery, insisting that 'there is no medical reason' for my pain, although there is much peer-reviewed medical literature to support the existence and mechanism of post-lasik eye pain! I have missed countless days of work, my family does not understand what I am going through ... I am in constant pain and the meds to control the pain make me groggy.

1064755,2008-06-23,"This letter addresses my concern about the safety of lasik surgery. I have practiced ophthalmology for thirty-three years. After taking all the courses on lasik, I decided not to do the surgery. I believe lasik surgery is not consistent with the ophthalmologist's hypocritic oath of ""first do no harm."" statistics on complications could easily be manipulated by surgeons and I don't think their reporting of complications can be relied upon. I think a few points are more valid: it was reported in the last year in the literature that lasik surgeons have an income creating the setting for significant bias. A highly significant fact that seeMs to be passed over without much comment is that the lasik flap can be easily lifted for up to at least ten years exposing the pt to the risk of dislocating and/or losing the flap when subjected to injury. A recent article told of four such cases after ten yrs. When I have explained this fact to hundreds of patients who were considering lasik, everyone stated that it is enough reason not to do the surgery. I explained to them that it's as if you had a circular patch of skin incised and replaced and it could be easily lifted up ten years later. Everyone is overwhelmed with this fact and say they are convinced that they won't do the surgery. When I have seen patients that have had lasik surgery with other doctors, none of them were aware of this fact. We are playing russian roulette with these patients, hoping statistically that they won't be hit in the eye. We are also playing this roulette game hoping beyond all hope that they don't get infection, but we all know infections happen. I went to a meeting at the last conference in 2007 which was concerned with how commonly senior citizens eyes become irritated from Dryness and the use of multiple preservatives over the years. I asked the panel at the meeting, many of whom are lasik surgeons, why aren't we more concerned about the damaging effects of lasik which causes Dry eye and damaged corneal nerves. They elected not to answer the question. I think we have a panel already in this country that is ideal to give you the answer to the probleMs with lasik. The panel consists of the thousands of ophthalmologists who chose not to do this procedure knowing they could make a half million dollars more per year. I think you should send a questionnaire out to all the ophthalmologists, especially those who don't do this surgery and ask them why they don't do it. I have seen other examples of where the fda allows higher risk manipulations of the eyes when it clearly is against the patients' interest. Two of these examples are allowing all-in-one chemical solutions for contact lenses without advising the patient to rinse off the detergent and disinfectant with saline. These patients are soaking their eye all day in these two irritating chemicals. The three most commonly used solutions do not recommend rinsing. Another pandering to patients is the following of no-stitch cataract surgery, even though medicare has shown the doubling of the incidence of infection in the eyes in the last ten years since no-stitch surgery has been initiated. This is not likely a coincidence. The three examples cited in the letter, I.e., lasik surgery, all -in-one contact lens solutions, and no-stitch cataract surgery are all examples of pandering to patients vulnerable instincts in an effort to promote a ""wow"" factor, rather than a healthier outcome. I have seen over the last thirty-five years in ophthalmology a steady trend within the profit side of medicine taking precedence over ""first do not harm"".",Infection; Dryness; Flap Issues

In 2007, I was given an enhancement to ""delete"" the monovision - that is what the practice called the procedure. I had explained on numerous occasions that I felt something had gone terribly wrong.

I am a board certified ophthalmologist (cornea specialist) who perforMs lasik and prk as well as cataract surgery. What most refractive surgeons omit telling pts is that refractive surgery changes the curvature and dynamics of the cornea. This makes intraocular pressure monitoring (important in glaucoma diagnosis and treatment) and intraocular lens calculations for cataract surgery difficult. If the preoperative, operative and postoperative info is available, it can be used to better calculate the true intraocular pressure and implant power. Most refractive surgery pts are in their 20s and 30s but glaucoma and cataracts don't become probleMs for decades later. By this time the medical record is lost or unavailable. To help address this issue, I have started a web-based refractive surgery database where pts or their refractive surgeons can store this info for further use.

I was only -1.25 in each eye and could almost make due without glasses. After the lasik surgery, my left eye slowly started to deteriorate. I was getting dizzy spells and migraine headaches daily. I started taking pain killers. I went to may optometrist to see if I could get a pair of glasses because all I could see out of my left eye was light. She told me that my left cornea was severely damaged and it was shaped like a football. I immediately made an appointment to see a Dr, the man who performed my lasik surgery. He made me and my grandfather wait for 5 hours in the waiting room. When I finally got in to see him, he admitted there was a major complication and blamed the laser, not hiMself. Dr said that there may have been a malfunction in the laser and there was nothing he could do for me. Dr was very rude to me and my grandfather. He rushed out of his office before answering all of our questions. He told us he had a meeting to go to and if we had any other questions, we had to make another appointment. In the following weeks, I consulted many corneal experts who came up with the same conclusion that I needed a corneal transplant. After a proper donor was found I had my transplant done in 2003. A corneal transplant is not a pleasant procedure. They cut the cornea out of your eye, replace it with a donor's cornea and in my case it took over 30 stitches in my eye. The removal of the stitches is done a few at a time, only when the stitch loosens with a needle like instrument while you are conscious, which resulted in numerous Dr visits. I had to pay dollars for that surgery. I also paid for a lens implant procedure done in 2005. My Dr had told me to prepare for many other future procedures and that my cornea can reject at any time. So far I have lost almost 2 yrs of income as a police officer and have depleted my entire savings including my 401k. I have since been able to return to work, however, had to be assigned to a different division (because of my eyesight) with a lesser rate of pay. I will never be able to work in the street again. I consulted a lawyer who paid experts to look over my files. I was told you need an expert witness to testify on your behalf. After further investigation, I found out that all of these experts were lasik eye Drs theMselves and were very reluctant to testify against each other. I am not trying to scare people  with my story I just don't want this to happen to anyone else. Lasikplus continues to use false advertisement as the story below  indicates. They made me believe that the worse complications would never lead to blindness. I went blind in my left eye and my only option was a corneal transplant. The worst part of my ordeal was the way Dr treated me after the complication. Dr offered me no options of how to correct my vision nor did he show any sympathy towards me. Story update - as many of you know, I just posted my first story. To make a long story short I had lasik surgery done. I had a very low prescription in each eye. I was young and naive at the time. The result of that surgery left me blind n my left eye and in need of a corneal transplant. I was off of work for almost two years. I had a few lawyers that looked at my files but declined to take my case. I was told you need an expert witness to testify against the Dr. My lawyer told me that because lasik is a relatively new procedure, it is very difficult to prove negligence against the Dr. She said you almost need to get one lasik Dr to testify against another lasik Dr. At the time I was really just trying to get my vision back. The lawsuit was not a major priority. In the last few years as I struggle daily with my vision probleMs Dry eyes, halos, starbursts and just overall poor vision. I decided to make a few websites to warn people about lasik to tell my story. I also posted my story on a few blogs. To my surprise Dr, the man who performed my lasik surgery contacted me. He pretended like he was really sorry for my situation. I asked him why it took him seven 7 years to contact me. I deep down thought the only reason  he was contacting me was because of the negative press I was giving him on my websites and blogs. He convinced me that he really was sorry for my outcome and that he had sympathy for my situation. I was lead to believe that either him or lasik plus was going to cover my medical expenses, lost wages and or offer me a settlement. He told me in an email that he was going to put me in contact with a rep from lasik who was mindful of what I have been through. That turned out to be very untrue. He put in in contact with a lawyer from lasik through email, asked me to fax him my medical bills and records. He said he would get back to me after he reviewed them. After several weeks went by, and I didn't hear anything I called them. His secretary said he was in a meeting and transferred to his voice mail. I asked him if there was any progress being made and to give  me a call. He did not call me back. I then waited a few more weeks and called him on his cell phone. He assured me he would call me on the following thursday. He did not call me thursday. He then sent me an email that he was unable to call me thursday but would call me monday. Guess what? He did not call me monday. He then sent another email that he had to leave work early monday but would call me tuesday. Tuesday came by and again no phone call. It has been over a month now and I have not heard from Dr, or anyone from lasik.

By week 6, I had severe lasik induced nerve damage Dry eyes. My eyes were bone Dry and the pain was unbearable for the first 10 months post-lasik. I could feel the pain with every blink of every day. Even closing my eyes provided minimal relief. All the eye doctors could do was tell me to keep using artificial tears, put me on restasis, and put plugs in my puncta -the Drains of the eye-. These things provided minimal relief. The pain was so intense with so little relief from existing therapies that I found myself researching suicide options on the internet. Prior to lasik, I was a happy family man with a good job. To think that I could find myself in this type of position because of lasik, an unnecessary fda approved procedure, was beyond belief. I am now over 2 years post-lasik and I suffer from senseless, permanent disabilities incurred from lasik. There are many things that I no longer can do such as being in a room with moving air from ceiling fans, heating vents, or air conditioning. I can only work limited hours due to the chronic post-lasik pain that I endure. I suffer from chronic eye pain that intensifies as the day goes on. I would write more but I don't think anyone in the fda who has any decision making authority reads these reports because if they did, I would expect that they would feel a shock to their conscience that the fda continues to allow people's eyes and lives to be ruined by lasik, a senseless, non-medically necessary procedure. I've heard lasik physicians compare lasik to other cosmetic procedures. That's absurd! If somebody has a poor outcome with breast augmentation, they can still go to work and/or Drive at night. A person's eyes are their most vital sensory organ. If you damage a person's eyes, you damage that person in the most significant way.

1174023,2008-09-23,"I had custom wavefront lasik surgery in late 2006. The treatment used an alcon ladar 6000 excimer laser system made by alcon refractive horizons. I had an adverse outcome, with under-correction and increased central curvature errors in both eyes. My doctor reported topographical irregularities to alcon, including a ""significantly steeper central area"". In addition to details of my specific case, the doctor also reported that the facility had experienced a substantial increase in the overall number of enhancement treatments required compared to their prior alcon ladar 4000 system. According to my doctor, alcon did not provide any info then and no further info was received from alcon until the ladar 6000 device safety alert was issued on february 21, 2007. I was given one additional enhancement treatment in the left eye in 2007 and two additional enhancement treatments in the right eye in 2007 and 2008. These procedures were successful in removing residual refractive errors but, since custom treatment was regarded as ""off-label"" for enhancement procedures, no attempt was made to resolve my high-order aberrations. I continued to complain of blurry vision, double images, glare and halos. More debilitating, though, were headaches I experienced in any vision-intensive activity, particularly with high detail and/or motion. Even routine activities like shopping became difficult. I continue to receive regular eval and monitoring from my doctor, but all treatment options through the local facility have been exhausted. I then decided to pursue other treatment options at other facilities, both regionally and nationally. I made numerous attempts to ask questions of alcon. Since alcon's device safety report mentioned topographically-observed central islands, but did not describe any of the island parameters, I asked alcon what range of topographic parameters they included in their use of the term ""central islands"". Since the device safety alert mentioned probleMs at other surgical centers, I asked for references to other doctors who might be doing follow-up eval and/or treatment of alcon ladar 6000 patients. Since alcon had collected considerable info from my personal medical records through contact directly with my doctor, I asked alcon to provide a summary report -without any patient's personally identifiable info-, including typical central island parameters, possible changes over time, and any additional treatments that had been tried at other facilities. The telephone number alcon had provided in the fda recall was not even the right department at alcon, so it took a number of days for alcon to decide who I should contact. Alcon's eventual response was not from any medically qualified staff person, but rather from their legal department, stating that they were unable to answer any of my questions. Alcon has also intervened and interfered with my attempt to enlist the services of another medical facility. Finally, when my doctor asked alcon many of the same questions, alcon also declined to respond to the doctor. As of 2008, alcon had not responded to even one of my questions or any of my doctor's questions.

When I asked which office he was at, Dr(first) told me that he was out of the office. I had eye surgery in 2008 at the office with Dr(second). Immediately that night, I experienced probleMs. When I tried to call vision center, we only got a recording. There was no emergency number listed on the space for phone numbers on the papers that they sent home. When I paged Dr(first) there was no response. At 1am on the next day, a friend Drove me to the er. They too tried to page Dr(first) and tried to call Dr(second) and vision one. All the doctors could do for me at the er was to prescribe a pain pill and sedative, -which should have been prescribed by second Dr to begin with-. The er visit cost almost $500. I continued to have probleMs and went to see Dr(first) my optometrist. He really didn't know what to do because he is not a surgeon. He said I should just keep putting Drops in my eyes and it would get better. When Dr(first) took the contact bandages off, my right eye got worse immediately. I called up Dr(first) and he said that I needed to give it time and it would get better. My eye was too painful to be able to see and I was not able to work. After a week and a half I returned to Dr(first) and by that time I had serious issues with my right eye. After talking to second Dr by phone, I was referred to an eye surgeon, another Dr. I went to Dr(third) and he had to perform surgery to lift the flap on my right eye and clean underneath it due to growths around and under the flap. My eye was very painful all over again, and I was not able to see clearly or work. I continued to see him a few times a week for several weeks. It was at that time I learned Dr(second) does not live in town. He lives in another state. That is the reason why he could not see my when I developed probleMs. If I had known that he does not live here, I never would have used him as my lasik surgeon. Now after several mos of going out for appointments with third Dr, I still can not see out of my right eye. It is like looking out of a blurry dirty film. It can not be corrected with lenses or glasses. I have to have another surgery on nov. 6 and Dr(third) says I will need another in 4-6 mos. So far I have been billed for thousands of dollars and that does not include prescriptions or patches that I had to buy. That does not include the surgery on approx five months later, or any future visits to Dr. Foulkes. I have had to miss weeks of work due to pain and loss of vision. I have had to take off work to Drive out to hinsdale to see Dr(third) many times. Lasik surgery performed by second Dr on original date. Follow up care by Dr(third) to try to correct probleMs. On ten days later, corrective procedure performed by Dr(third) to lift flap of right eye to clean underneath. On the next day, follow up care Dr(third), two days later follow up care Dr(third), three days later follow up care Dr(third), the following month(two days later) follow up care same Dr, five days later follow up care same Dr, three days later follow up care same Dr, a week later follow up care same Dr, the following month follow up care Dr, eighteen days later follow up eye surgery to clean under flap in right eye by Dr, three days later follow up care same Dr.",Flap Issues; Night Issues; Pain
1212031,2008-10-24,"I had lasik eye surgery on both eyes. I was at -3 diopter with slight astigmatism in both eyes before the surgery. I was near sighted. Before the surgery and during the surgery, I was not given any instruction on what to do with my eyes. The night before I read in the prep booklet that I was supposed to focus on the light. Following this direction I focused on the light during the surgery for my right eye, but when it came to my left eye, I had trouble focusing on the light, so I moved my eye to re-focus, and after the second time of doing this, the doctor finally directed me to stop moving my eye. Anyway, after the surgery, my left eye felt strange right away, like it was irritated more than the right eye and the vision wasn't as good. With the post-op care I told my doctors that my left eye was always irritated, but they couldn't tell what was wrong with it, only agree that it appeared to be more irritated than the right. It's a year and a half later and my left eye still feels the same pretty much all the time, like there's something in the eye, like I'm wearing a contact that should have been taken out a long time ago. The vision out of that eye is somewhat fuzzy as well. My doctors say that the only problem they see is that my eyes are Drier now; about 6 second tear break-up time. They say that the irritation could be caused by sensitivity to dust, wind, particles in the air that wouldn't have irritated the eye before with a healthy tear film, but now do, because of the Dry eyes. And this doesn't explain why the left eye feels so irritated and has poorer vision than the right, even though the Dry eye is the same in both. When first dealing with this condition, I believe I had ptsd because I had suicidal ideations and had serious plans to kill myself of three separate occasions. I've had depression before, but never suicidal thoughts. This was shocking and a horrible experience. I am grateful to vision surgery rehab. I talked on the phone and email and shared my fears and my emotional distress and I finally came out of my suicidal ideation phase. Dr was helpful in giving me eye health info.

1213589,2008-10-27,"I had lasik in both eyes in 2008. I had high prescription of contacts at a -8.50 in left eye and -9.50 in right eye. Very high prescrip. My surgeon, Dr diagnosed me with Dry eye before I had surgery when he was doing some tests. I shouldn't have had this surgery. After surgery, I saw like a freak immediately, though mostly clear, my world has turned upside down. My floor is crooked, my walls are stretched, circles aren't round anymore, my eyes were changing constantly being even one whole diopter different, I was overcorrected, and eventually when I got stern enough, he finally told me I had both decentered eyes. A nightmare I still live with everyday. What was not told to me until I gathered enough information from 15 docs or so, -most of whom would not tell me, only found out because I insisted on my records, that is, if they chose to put what it really was, I found some do not even write what they should on the charts- I found out I had epithelial ingrowth, blepharitis, corneal haze, corneal swelling, post-op astigmatism that the laser gave me!, irregular flaps, and some more I probably don't remember right now. One month after surgery, after my lying doc said all I had was overcorrection, -I knew he had to be lying- I went for a second opinion at laser center and saw another Dr od, who worked for Dr(third)- he told me I was fine, I just saw freaky because I had such a high prescription and it would take a long time to heal -more lies- then said I too had corneal swelling- of which at that time I didn't know you have to treat with steroids. He did not treat me, told me to see my surgeon in the next week and sent me on my way. Well, because he didn't treat me, and I got to my surgeon too late, I now live with unbearable permanent damage from the corneal swelling seeing a ghosty line around everyone and everything and have no 3dimensional vision all due to him not treating me- I had an episode on the following month, where everything I saw had changed. Mind you, on top of the freak world I ""already"" lived in with moving, crooked walls, distortion, crooked floor, etc. -and you know what Dr(second) saw in my charts that I had dlk-therefore I even had pred forte on my counter and could have taken it till I got to my surgeon if ""he"" didn't ""want"" to treat me, and I wouldn't be living like this, had he told me what was going on and how I could fix it or event that I should see my surgeon asap today!, if he wasn't going to help! Good thing I have one honest doctor I can now turn to. But the damage is done and not repairable, and believe me if you had to live like this, you wouldn't want to. It's god awful existing this way and being ""forced"" to see things so wrong. After thousands of dollars spent, I have contacts that help some, but guess what I will never see normal again. Well, I guess I must add, that I do have severe Dry eye, of course halos and starbursts, and of course, loss of contrast in a big way. I also have corneal thinning, because I also have only 219 microns left in my left eye and not much more in my right. I fear ectasia, cataracts, corneal transplants if corneal swelling continues, which I've already had again this year! Lucky I know now, to go in right away and my new doc ""does"" treat me. I miss my beautiful world..can't seven see my own face straight; even with contacts. My nose moves because it is a different shape in one eye than the other, as well as all things being different shape, too. I went in thinking I'd have a miracle, and ended up hating life, trusting none, but one doctor, and having my life turned upside down and never being able to get past it, because it's always ""in front of me""! Imagine! Could you endure? Going through a day in life, is no fun and very scare, every day! You know what, even the words on this screen typing to you, do not go straight across, dipped in the middle, up on one end, down on the other and swerved. Can you even fathom living like this? The machine used on me, was an alcon ladarvision 4000, and if I went to a second opinion doc, and I wouldn't let them known who my surgeon was, they'd just ask what was the machine used. I bet it's a faulty machine on top of finding out the doctor has a bad reputation. I've also learned of people who went to well world renowned docs and still had irreversible damage..I just don't think lasik should be done, period! I was responsible for deciding on this surgery, but the truth is, I trusted the doctors know what they are doing and would never do a surgery that would harm, if they knew it did, and I found out the worse, which is they do know it harMs! Included with that is all the hype that's it's virtually a piece of cake, and foolproof, to find out later the ruth is so many are harmed, -I've met those with transplants, now and who are blinded- and none of us should have to live like this.

1215203,2008-10-28,"I had lasik eye surgery from Dr. In 2006. It was the biggest mistake of my life. Here is a list of my concerns: - my last checkup occurred last year, and I still remained at 20/15 on my right eye and 20/20 on my left eye. This is very misleading as things over 20 feet are blurry. They're especially blurry in medium to low lighting. I had no idea that my eyesight was definitely going to be worse afterwards. I thought since 20/20 was very likely, my vision could remain perfect at far from it. My vision also fluctuates depending on how much rest I get. I believe it's because the more I rested I am, the bigger my pupils are. Bigger pupils lead to seeing more through untreated parts. -they only treated my eyes partially and did not warn me of this . The treatment zone simply did not cover my entire eye. I have big pupils. The cut did not go outside of my pupils but within it. The outer area of my pupils remains untreated. I was not warned of this. I just cannot understand how they can get away with something like this as it has severely affected my vision for the worse. -I was not warned that I was going to get a permanent scar on my eyes. I believe it plays a big part of my blurred vision. -I was not warned that my night vision was definitelly going to get worse. I was very shocked the next day to see that my night vision definitely got worse. This should not be a surprise. I was simply warned about the possibility of getting starbursts and halos. I have a severe case of both. Based on the size of my pupils, they should have told me that the likelihood was high. -Dry eyes are a constant problem for me. I've experienced loss of sleep and lack of sleep, due to extreme Dryness that wakes me up or severe crust formations that did not exist before surgery. I was not aware that there are tests to determine how Dry your eyes are. This should be a mandatory test. I have to put several eye Drops a day- probably for the rest of my life. This is very costly, embarrassing, and bothersome. - I had red eye for about one month on my left eye. I had no idea that this could happen. It was very embarrassing to have it when I wanted to prove to co-workers and friends that lasik was safe and recommendable, but was I simply showing them proof that I made a mistake. The reputation of my judgement has probably been significantly damaged. -it takes a long time focusing on different distances. If I'm reading something and look up to something, it takes seconds to focus on it. This was always instant before. I was not warned of this. -the stats provided by the media and the ads are absurd. My surgeon asked me if I was glad to have done the surgery the day after. I said I was. He may have put that on record. No one's asked my how I'm doing now. Based on my own personal survey of people having done the surgery, most have regrets. Dates of use: 2006. Diagnosis or reason for use: near-sightedness.",Halos; Starbursts; Dryness; Night Issues

I went back to Dr. Norden and he inserted plugs in my tear ducts and explained that women over 40 tend to have this problem. I would liked to have been warned beforehand so I could have made a more informed decision about this procedure. Now, over a year later, I still have plugs in my tear ducts and wake up in the middle of the night with difficulty opening my eyes and have to put Drops in to be able to sleep. My eyes are sore, very Dry, and puffy in the morning and I'm concerned about the long-term effects. I have been given a prescription for restasis but am afraid of forming a dependency.

I had followed all instructions given to me by Dr. Went home & put on protective eye gear and laid down for 4 hours, as instructed. Then got up and put in zymar antibiotic then forte med. The nex day.- post op- cleaned out pus in right eye. After I left lviinsit., had difficulty Driving with blurred to my right eye. Six days laterI- -post op- eyes at this time felt pretty good. Still using quite a bit of fresh tears & forte. The next day-. My eyes seem to be doing okay. Still very Dry & using fresh tears at least every 2 hrs. In early 2005- eyes improving slowly. Still using eye Drops for Dryness. Approx two and a half months later- feeling tired, possibly from thyroid condition, & also eyes tire easily. Had thyroid condition checked & everything was normal.

Still using fresh tears for Dry eyes. Have asked about enhancement and they still can't give me an answer on when I can have it done. It's been 6 mos now. I feel I am getting the run around. Approx two months later- friday-post op- I am not happy with results. Now am up to 2.25 on cheater glasses. Eyes are regressing, not progressing like I thought they would. It has been 7 mos and I asked again about my eye enhancement & was told I was not ready for enhancement yet! They keep putting me off from having another eye enhance-ment. I still feel they are giving me the run around. At least that is the feeling I am getting from the doctors. Eyes are tired & strained by the end of the day. Am using fresh tears more frequently during the day. Approx three months later - post op- eyes are getting worse, not better. Asked about enhancement & have been out off again. Now up to 2.5 on reading glasses. Still using fresh eyes daily. The same day-post op- eyes are not getting better. Getting worse. Asked about enhancement, put off again. Now up to 2.5 reading glasses. More fresh eyes more often during the day. The following month-post op- still using 2.5 cheater glasses. Now having probleMs Driving at night. No go on enhancement again. Using fresh tears to keep eyes moist. Approx one and a half months later - thurs -eye exam- 9 to 10:30 am. Went ot my optometrist, for an eye exam because I couldn't figure out what was going on with my eyes. Dr did a thorough exam because I couldn't figure out what was going on with my eyes. Dr did a thorough exam on both eyes. He also had his associate, another Dr formerly employed by the laser institute, with my permission, to exam both of my eyes. Both Drs were in agreement, that I should be seen at the lasik vision institute as soon as possible, both talked about me having cells in both of my eyes. Which was not a good sign. I did not understand what they meant by this. Three days later - as soon as I left the optometrists office, I made a call. They told them what my optometrist said. They scheduled an appt for me immediately for the very next day. Appt schedule for the next day for 11:45 am. The following day.

1252365,2008-11-25,"Since having intralasik eye surgery, I have developed posterior vitreous detachment or severe floaters. I have also suffered from Dry eye as well as eye strain. The suction cup used in the lasik procedure sucks out vitreous opacities from the back of the eye leading to the appearance of floaters. Lasik doctors do not inform their clients on the possible dangers that the suction cup may have on the structure of the eye or creation of floaters. Lasik doctors also misinform their clients by telling them that nerve regeneration will occur after nerve severing is initiated. The truth of course is that there are no recorded scientific evidence that nerve regeneration fully occurs. In fact, 5 year studies from school of ophthalmology find that nerve regeneration reaches only 80 percent of preoperative levels. Five years, imagine eye doctors telling their patients that it may take as long as five years for their cornea nerves to regenerate 80 percent, that is, if they do at all, there is of course no guarantee. It is no wonder that Dry eyes is the most prevalent side effect after lasik, doctors simply distort the facts to advance their cause. The fda has completely Dropped the ball when it comes to holding the lasik industry accountable for medical malpractice. There is ample data from credible doctors and universities that substantiate my claim that lasik is harmful to the eye, and that doctors knowingly mislead the patient in the hope to secure his or her business. The facts are simple, lasik creates Dry eye, floaters, compromises the integrity of the eye, and in many cases creates psychological cases of depression, hopelessness and disillusionment toward humanity and its supposed hippocratic moral keepers. The fda and its lobbyists are just as complacent in this farce as are its executioners. In fact, one could say the fda, as supposed guardians of the people, are even more at fault for allowing such a ""abject"" procedure to manifest itself. Evil permitted is sometimes worse then evil committed. Its time for the fda to redeem itself and put an end to lasik surgery once and for all, or at the very least force doctors to be as a honest and forthcoming about the potential side effects of lasik as I am now.

1284908,2009-01-08,"I had lasik surgery to my left eye and prk to the right eye in 2007 at the vision center,. I had planned to have the surgery done in 2006, but decided to pass due to my family visiting us and travel commitments. Before making the final commitment to have the eye surgery, I went through a number of tests at the vision center to ensure that I was a good candidate for the surgery. Dr and several of the other examining doctors assured me that I was good candidate for lasik surgery. Dr indicated that having lasik would reduce the time for recovery and be less painful overall. I talked myself into having the surgery and decided to go for it in the same month. I was all set to have the procedure done the morning of the same month when another Dr, the surgeon performing the eye surgery, suggested to have the tests redone since it been six months from the last examination. It made sense, so after the completed examination, Dr(second) informed me the left was fine for lasik surgery but he felt that I should reconsider to have prk surgery on the right eye. His reasoning was that my prescription and astigmatism were stronger on the right eye and felt that having lasik would not get the results I wanted. Secondly, he said that if later down the road I wanted to have nay corrections made, they would not be able to perform additional surgeries on the right eye because the cornea was not thick enough. This all occurred 10 minutes before the surgery was to take place. He did state it would take much longer to heal, up to 6 months - 3 months for the lasik-for the vision to achieve the desired state. At the time, I did not think it sounded like too long to wait. I spent 48 years of my life with glasses-six months was not a long time. I should have walked away and re-evaluated the length of time. I had spoken to other people who had the surgery, and they didn't have any Dryness at all or if they did it only lasted a couple of weeks. My eyes were in constant pain following the surgery and lasted for months. The nerve endings were supposed to heal within 2-3 weeks, but in some cases they never return to their normal or previous state. This is something that I was not told before having the surgery. If they would have told me this I would have passed on the surgery. The bottom line is that I suffered daily with pain, Dryness, and burning for almost 9 months. I experienced periods of deep anxiety, depression and the inability to sleep that began about 30 days after the initial surgery. The resulting surgery has left me with extreme night vision probleMs including halos, star-bright and double vision. I'm afraid to Drive at night. Following the surgery, I suffered with high anxiety and depression for over 8 months, which resulted in having to take many strong medications for anxiety and depression, including 3 days in a mental facility. I still take the antI-depressant medication and suffer daily with vision probleMs that affect my ability to read. My job requires that I work on the computer all day. The resultant surgery almost cost me my job due to lost work days and the inability to travel. For the first 6 months following the surgery, I experienced extreme difficulty sleeping and had to take strong addictive medications, such as lorazepam - anxiety- and ambien cr sleep deprivation. It has been 21 months since the surgery and my vision is still poor in the both eyes. Additionally, more in the right eye. I meet with Dr wright at the vision center in 2008. After several tests, Dr(first) indicated the right eye prk surgery could not be corrected. Additional surgery to the right eye may not improve the astigmatism or the halos and star-bright conditions. Dr(first) configured a pair of eye glasses after his examination hoping that it would improve vision in the right eye, but proved useless. The story does not have a pretty ending. Prior to the surgery, my eyes were correctable with eye glasses. After surgery both of eyes maintain the astigmatism and include additional defects such as halos, star-bright, and double vision. Not to mention the visual daily strain on my eyes because of the astigmatism. Unfortunately, I was one of the few that experienced sever probleMs as a result of the eye surgery. The fact that no support structure was in place for patients who experienced that trauma as I did made the situation even worse. I tried to get help from lasik plus, but all they could say to me was , we are sorry. My family went through a very painful period after my surgery. I was fortunate to have a wife who prayed and comforted me through this period but after 6-7 moths of being up all night and having to stay home with me during some of the rough days, it took its toll on her as well. If it were not for my strong relationship with jesus christ and many christian brothers and sisters praying for me daily, would have most likely taken my life.

1515842,2009-10-21,"Sent this series of emails to the director of security, in 2009: I am a woman who was in the parking lot, when a siren, which I am assuming was one that is used for tornado alerts, went off. After it did, I experienced floaters in my eyes and still have them 24 hrs later. I am going to contact my Dr tomorrow, but wanted to let you know about this since it occurred right after I heard the loud sirens go off in the parking lot. I wanted to try and find out if this was a test, and if it was, I am very understanding of the fact that these must be tested from time to time, but I also wanted you to know that the sound in that parking lot was deafening. It is not something I would want to go through again if I could avoid it. Please let me know if this was a test at that time and if you have had any other reports of this causing any other health issues. Reply from director of security: you were correct in that, the city tests their sirens the first saturday of every month at noon. I will pass this info onto the city. What do you mean by floaters in my eyes? I am assuming it means an uncontrollable tearing or watering. I have not heard of any other health effects from other residents, but the city may. Again, I will check the city. My reply to director of security: update: I have just returned after having an eye exam. Dr examined me and said that he did not see any major problem with my eyes, which I was greatly relieved to hear. I have done some research on these floaters and found the following concerning them: most spots and floaters in the eye are harmless and merely annoying. Many will fade over time and become less bothersome. Sometimes people are interested in surgery to remove floaters, but doctors are willing to perform such surgery only in rare instances. However, the sudden appearance of a significant number of floaters, especially if they are accompanied by flashes of light or other vision disturbances, could indicate a retinal detachment or other serious problem in the eye. Here is more on sudden sound: sudden sound is an urgent wake-up call that alerts and activates the stress response of a biological alarm that affects the brain in  powerful ways. Because loud noise often heralds bad news, animals and humans have evolved a rapid response to audio stressors: the roar of a carnivore, the crack of a falling tree, the scream of a child. More recently: the explosion of a weapon, the wail of a siren, the crash of the stock market. I would like to suggest that you take a measuring instrument down to the area and measure the decimals in the parking lot there. I think you would be surprised at how loud the siren is in that area. I am hoping my symptoMs will lessen with time, but a small child or baby may not have the capacity to put their hands over their ears when the siren goes off in the future. Thank you for your response and I hope you will take this to heart and follow up on it. The max level allowed is 123 decibels. I never heard back from director of security on this. The reason I am sending this to the u.s. Food and Drug administration is that I had lasik surgery on both eyes back in 1997 and it was a success, but I wondered after this issue with the floaters happened, which I still have, but the flashes of light are gone now, happened if it makes your eyes more susceptible to having probleMs like this from loud noises.

Finally, exhausting all other explanations for these outbreaks, we replaced our moria microkeratome with one manufactured by another company, and discontinued use of mona one.

Then I started to notice the night vision probleMs. I use to be able to see things almost perfectly in the dark, able to make out details on people's faces even without my glasses; now, on the other hand, I cannot walk down a hallway without touching the wall because I will run into it, and I find this very disheartening and actually depressing. More of a giant concern on my part is that my astigmatism has come back, and now it's just about the same if not worse than it was prior to the surgery. I've been back in glasses for 3 years now, and I have gone back once after the procedure to tell them my vision was getting blurred, but they looked at my eyes and dismissed it as a mere eye infection and it'll be okay. As if I didn't know my eyes! It was true I had a minor infection earlier that week, but never has an infection blurred my vision like that -nor lasted for 3-4 years- and I never went back. I was never told that my eyes would revert back to a prior if not worse state, I was never told that there would be severe night vision probleMs, that the halos around lights would make Driving at night in the rain near impossible- meaning on several events I've had to pull over and wait it out or stop by a friend's house that was close by for the night. Never! This is the worst mistake I've ever made in my life, and I'm an artist! It kills me to know that soon enough I'll never be able to do my work that I love, and I've been fitted with glasses, but year after painful year, the prescription gets worse and worse, and at a more rapid speed than before the surgery. ""risk free and with out glasses my rear"". I'm seriously hating life since the surgery, and if I had really known or been told outright that these risks were debilitating then I'd have passed it up, been happy with being able to see at night with comfortably moist eyes and still having to get a prescription every year.",Infection; Halos; Dryness; Night Issues; Astigmatism; Pain
1552421,2009-12-02,"Four years after receiving lasik surgery, I experienced retinal tears in my left eye. The tear was severe leading to some loss of vision and a significant amount of bleeding, leading to loss of vision and some compromise in the quality of my life. By way of background, I had the surgery at age 51. I needed two separate procedures because, I am very nearsighted and a good deal of material in both eyes needed to be removed to ""correct"" my vision. It took nearly a year for the swelling to go down after the first operation. After it did go down, a second corrective procedure was performed. Even after two surgeries, I required corrective lenses because my vision was not consistently sharp. In fact, it varied a great deal depending upon the time of day. Tiredness and stress. About three years after the surgery, I had a spontaneous rupture of some fragile spots in the retina. My optometrist said that the trauma from the lasik procedure was a likely contributor. People with severe nearsightedness often have lattice degeneration and other conditions that may make lasik a questionable option for them. In my case, I am regretful that I had the procedure done. Today, the compromised eye is a continual distraction and my vision is much poorer. To stop the occurrence of continued tearing, I needed to undergo a painful and expensive emergency procedure where my retina was scarred by a laser and the application of liquid nitrogen. Today, I have scars that ""pucker"" the macula of the retina posing the chance that it may detach further. I also experience Dry-eye and associated discomfort, difficulty reading, night Driving, and other inconveniences. I question the safety and efficacy of lasik procedures. I do believe that their use needs to be restricted. I do not -based upon results- feel that I was a good candidate. I am far worse off now than I was before the surgery.",Dryness; Night Issues; Bleeding; Pain

Over the last 4 years, I have experienced ""cornea"" regression, having lost approximately 1/3 of my correction. My doctor explained it as my having a high degree of elasticity in my cornea. What people need to know is that while lasik is permanent, the lasting correction result are not. They never tell you that when they are selling lasik, because it's all about the dollars. So now they want to do a second correction. Moreover, they down play the fact that opening up the cornea flap increase the change of complications. Secondly, burning away more cornea material to correct this regression will only further weaken the cornea. A few years later, I will be right back needing yet another correction, assuming I have enough cornea material left. Because of the increased Dry eyes as a result of lasik, it is usually difficult to wear soft contacts for more than 8 hours to correct my vision. Had the fda done long term studies on this surgery, a lot of people would have elected to just keep wearing soft lenses, and save all their money. The industry/lasik medical equipment pushed this surgery through the fda for approval, and the consumer is left with a bad case of buyer's remorse and the lasik blues.",Dryness; Flap Issues; Regression

1559401,2009-12-09,"Severe Dry eyes after prk surgery. To start off with, I am a physician in practice for 4 years and am well read and have a high level of medical understanding, and voluntarily chose to have prk surgery. I was made aware of potential se, but had no idea how bad they could be. Having never tried contacts, I spoke with a recommended ophthalmologist who recommended prk, a similar procedure to lasik, and done with the same laser. I was excited at the idea of perfect vision -I now have 20/15 b/l vision-, and although I did read up on the procedure on the internet and the information he gave me, it seemed like a no-brainer. In retrospect, I feel the potential negative outcomes are downplayed but if you are one of those unlucky enough to get them, you'll wish you never had the surgery, as I do. So, the problem. I had the surgery in 2007 and severe pain afterwards for about 1-2 weeks. After that, things seemed to get better, but I did have Dry eyes for the next six months. I thought and was led to believe that I was out of the woods when about 16 months later, in 2009, I had severe Dry eyes in which my eyelids stuck to my eyeballs every time I would awake in the am. My corneas would get damaged from the epithelium being ripped off. This damage was confirmed on exam by my ophthalmologist. I want to be very clear here, in my entire life, had probleMs with Dry eyes, and there is no family history either. The next month or two were hell and I was literally afraid to go to sleep, Dreading the excruciating pain I knew would come when I would wake. My doctor tried to say this had nothing to do with the surgery, and I think that this is ridiculous, and he eventually acknowledged the likely relationship. I ended up trying numerous different eye Drops, including restasis, using a humidifier, sleeping without heat, having protective contacts placed on my eyes, and getting upper and lower plugs placed in my tear ducts. When the summer came, with the higher humidity, things were better, but now that the winter's here again, I'm again experiencing Dry eyes. We did find one product that helped, and no I have nothing to do with the company that makes it- and I have to goop my eyes with this product every night to prevent my eyelids from sticking to my eyeballs, though thankfully this does work. I never reported this to the fda in the past, and don't know if my ophthalmologist did, but I would never recommend this surgery to anyone and certainly wouldn't have gone through with it if I knew this could happen. In addition, I think it was inappropriate for my surgeon to recommend the surgery before recommending that I try contacts, and I wonder how much of this has to do with the fact that he just bought the machine and is more than happy to cut on people's eyes if they're willing to pay, which I was. Mfr name, city and state: I don't know, but I don't think this is the issue. The problem is with the procedure, not the laser.",Dryness; Night Issues; Pain

I had to put two Drops of lubricating 4-5 times a day. But in 2008, when I put genteal lubricating Drops, I got some allergy or infection in my eyes. I got it treated through putting ""antI oxidants"" -tetracycline hydrocloride- Drops for some 5-6 days. But this created a tightening of ligaments, muscle spasMs and constant pain in the nerves beneath my left eye. I could not now put lubricating Drops, due to this besides having Dryness. Putting Drops would create additional pain in the nerves and stretch the nerves. Working on computers and travelling outside is still next to impossible. This has got me nightmares and totally hampered my confidence. The pain below the left eye has still not subsided. There is still consistent pain in muscle tissues and veins. It becomes too difficult to tolerate. I could not understand what the problem is? Even in night time, I can feel the pressure-weight- in my veins and constant stretch of veins which causes me immense pain in sleeping. I change my lubricants and sometimes, I feel a little subsiding of the pain. But after continuing for some more time, it again emerges. The eyes are not red. I tried vitamin medicine for veins-. I felt better with it, but only for 3 days. Afterwards, it again re emerged. Also, I have now stopped all lubricants but the pain does not subside. When I work on computers, the pain increases a lot.

The ability to see objects close to me. The radius of my lost ""near vision"" has continued to grow over the past three + years and now extends to approx four feet from my face. I have no genetic history that would explain the sudden and continued loss of my reading vision. Additionally, I now experience frequent headaches from the constant effort of trying to focus my eyes from near to distant objects. I experience mild discomfort in my right eye periodically, as if an eyelash was in my eye. Most disturbing to me is the damage to my peripheral vision: if I look at something out of the corners of my eyes, I experience severe double vision and dizziness. This was not something I had prior to lasik surgery, but presented immediately following the surgery.

The surgery was performed by a Dr. Follow-up surgeries were performed on each eye in a failed attempt to correct my probleMs. After dealing with these issues for two years, I was instructed by the doctor to simply wait for them to clear up, which still hasn't happened -it's now been more than four years since the original surgery-.

We have tried every type of therapy for the Dry eye with no success. Before the surgery I told Dr that my eyes were too Dry for me to wear contact lenses. He performed a tear test and told me that although my eyes were on the Dry side of normal, I was a good candidate. That has proved not to be the case. In my opinion, if eyes are too Dry for contact lens wear, that should be a serious warning sign that there may be Dry eye probleMs after lasik. If I had to do it over again I would not do lasik. A recent tear test performed by Dr shows that the tear production in the right eye is unchanged from prior to surgery, but tear production in the left eye is less than half what it was prior to surgery.

Dr recommended a clinical trial at the third facility - a crosslinking study for this very diagnosis. I am at this time enrolling in it.

1623564,2010-02-28,"On (b) (6) 2009, I underwent prk to correct my vision. The procedure was performed by Dr (b) (6). I expected to return to work the following monday. The week following the procedure, I noticed that I was nearly always dizzy, which caused symptoMs of nausea and forced me to rest, lying down, frequently throughout the day. The symptoMs interfered with my ability to pursue normal activities every day including housework, showering, and reading. I expected that my 'brain' would habituate to my new vision in time and that the dizzy symptoMs would subside. However, I continue to have probleMs with daily housework, reading, scrolling on the computer, and errands to the grocery store and other shopping centers. I am unable to work full-time as a classroom teacher and in jan 2010 my employment was permanently terminated. My symptoMs also interfere with my pursuit of normal 'recreational' activities. I described these symptoMs to Dr (b) (6), doctor of optometry responsible for my follow-up care, beginning one week after the procedure. He told me that no other pt had described to him dizzy symptoMs following vision correction surgery. One month after the procedure, Dr (b) (6) asked me to return to see Dr (b) (6) for an examination. Dr (b) (6) had also reported that no other pt had described dizzy symptoMs following eye surgery . Dr (b) (6)'s and Dr (b) (6)'s examinations revealed that my cornea was healing normally. Dr (b) (6) prescribed corrective lenses beginning in october. Initially, I was given progressive lenses that made my dizzy symptoMs worse. Next, we tried bifocal lenses, and they too made my dizzy symptoMs worse. Currently, I have 3 different pairs of glasses. One for reading only, one for distance only, and one that is an intermediate prescription. I am able to Drive, though I do have increased sensitivity to motion sickness, and do not need to wear prescription glasses for this activity. As the dizzy and associated symptoMs of nausea persisted, Dr (b) (6), my optometrist, suggested that I have an adjustment done by Dr (b) (6), the eye surgeon, in order to address my symptoMs. He thought that, since I was now slightly far-sighted, correcting my vision to 20/20 without the need to wear eyeglasses would reduce or eliminate my dizzy symptoMs. However, since both Dr (b) (6) and Dr (b) (6) had never heard a pt complaint of dizzy symptoMs following vision correction surgery, I decided it would be pertinent to see a neurologist about my problem. In other words, I thought I was necessary to seek the advice from a doctor who had experience with pts with complaints about dizzy symptoMs following vision correction surgery and how best to correct the problem. Dr (b) (6) and Dr (b) (6) also suggested that I see my primary care physician about my symptoMs to determine if there was some other issue, such as an ear infection or inner-ear problem, responsible for my symptoMs. I went to my pcp, Dr (b) (6), in late october for a referral to see a neurologist who could address my dizzy symptoMs. My pcp's eval did not reveal a cause for my dizzy symptoMs and agreed to refer me to the neurologist I requested. On (b) (6) 2009, I went ot see Dr (b) (6)-, a neurologist and vestibular disease expert at the dizziness and balance ctr, (b) (6), Dr (b) (6) had also not seen a pt complaining of dizzy symptoMs following refractive eye surgery for vision correction. His exam did not reveal any 'vestibular or cranial nerve defect', and he diagnosed a 'probable increase in motion sickness'. Dr (b) (6) prescribed rehabilitation/desensitization therapy to help with the symptoMs. I began therapy with (b) (6) in (b) (6) 2010. After completing 4 sessions, her comments suggested that I would need to continue desensitization exercises, and might experience these symptoMs for years or, perhaps, the rest of my life. Pn (b) (6) 2009, I went to see Dr (b) (6), an ophthalmologist -md, phd- at the (b) (6) eye center. He is a cornea expert and perforMs refractive eye surgery for vision correction. He too told me that he had never seen a pt who complained of dizzy symptoMs following this procedure. His exam did not reveal any anatomical abnormalities, and suggested that it may be an inner ear problem. Drs., (b) (6) and (b) (6) are both involved with research/case studies and had both reported to me that they had not seen, or read about, a case with a pt who complained of dizzy symptoMs and nausea following prk or a related procedure for vision correction. At this point I was frustrated, and disheartened, with not being able to find a doctor who had experience with the problem I was having and who could tell me whether or not an adjustment via an add'l prk procedure, or some other course of action, would correct my symptoMs. I am constantly compensating for my dizzy symptoMs every day. My symptoMs occur during daily activities, reading, scrolling on a computer, movement on the tv, and shopping at grocery stores, etc. Though my symptoMs are significantly better now than they were in october, the need to compensate every minute of every day is tiring. My symptoMs inhibit my pursuit of recreational activities, my interest in pursuing a doctorate degree, and future employment as I am not able to comfortably and confidently resume normal activities.

Now I have chronic Dry eye, eye allergies and light sensitivity. In the evening or in low-light, I see very apparent starbursts around bright lights, halos, glare, ghosting and reduced contrast sensitivity. During the day, even on a clear, bright sunny day I still see starbursts -daybursts- around very bright lights or shiny objects, glare and ghosting though not as bad as in low light. In fact I see starbursts and ghosting in all lighting conditions from very bright to very low light with the visual aberrations being the worst at night. I have also developed cataracts at (b) (6). No one in my family had cataracts before (b) (6) and most have gotten them much later. My brother is (b) (6) years older than I- and has no signs of cataracts. Neither did I prior to lasik 4 years ago. The worst part is that my surgeon -and other lasik doctors I have spoken with- can't tell me what exactly is causing my probleMs. In fact, most aren't even aware -my surgeon included- that daybursts -starbursts in bright light- exist!!! How can this be possible? Someone is lying to someone. How is it possible that these doctors are allowed to create such probleMs and not even understand what they are or how to treat them or even if treating them is possible or will ever be possible? Why wasn't I informed that I could no longer practice jujitsu because my lasik flap will never heal? Why was I told complications happen in < 1% of lasik surgeries when my girlfriend and I both have similar results in both eyes? That's a 100% complication rate with multiple complications. I find it hard to believe that by 2006, these probleMs were not reported by patients. Based on my experience with the lasik industry they don't want patients reporting these probleMs. Why not? Because lasik is much more risky than we were told or even that the medical community will admit to. So the answer must be (b) (4). They and possibly the fda did -do- it for the (b) (4).

But I found that after I had had my surgery, a judge from the (b) (6) court of (b) (6) had his eyes done before me by Dr (b) (6) and he did in fact examine the judge's eyes before his surgery. Apparently, Dr (b) (6) did not think my vision was as important as the judge's.

When I was examined by Dr's (b) (6) new optician -who I didn't realize at the time was new-, she called a more experienced optometrist into the room when she was examining my pupils because she didn't say out loud, but she thought something wasn't right... The optometrist said... Everything looks fine... I said what are you checking and she said oh nothing... It looks good??? Being the naive person I was back then. I let it ride... Then the optometrist examined my pupil size and said my pupils were a size 8.5. She used some kind of ruler to measure the pupils -not an electronic device- I said well that's awful close to the size 10 pupil cut off and she said if it were a 9 you would be really close, but since you're a 8.5 you would be okay. Again optometrist says everything looks good. I said are my pupils too large because I have huge pupils that cover almost my entire eye in the dark; no she assured me - my pupils were a size 8.5 and the cut off was 10. I later learned the cut off was 8 and they changed my file to 7.5 where they wrote down the pupil size, although on the computer tests some showed over a size 8.

When we arrived, was shown consent from just before going into surgery -funny they didn't let us read that ahead of time - it was a big rush and they were pushing us to finish initialing it so they could bring us into surgery.

(b) (6) then comes in room and says that Dr (b) (6) doesn't want to do surgery on her good eye because she has a lazy eye and if anything went wrong with her good eye she would be left with only the lazy one. We then hear doctor in hallway reprimanding optometrist for not telling him about (b) (6)'s lazy eye during her original eye exam in (b) (6)... Gee the same optometrist who examined me and said I was a candidate and told me the wrong pupil size for the cut-off. Cut-off was 8 not 10 on pupil size. Also during the original exam in (b) (6) when they dilate the eyes, (b) (6)'s eye dilatation was back to normal within a few hours, mine took entire day to return to normal. I called Dr (b) (6) office and asked the optometrist if that still made me a candidate given the fact my pupils were taking so long to go back to normal size and she said yes. While on the table for surgery, I said, Dr. ""are you sure I'm a candidate"" because, I've always been told I have really large pupils... And even been told by a cornea specialist it's best to not have surgery on my eyes. The Dr says, when did he tell you that, I said about 10 years ago and he said, that was a long time ago. I said sure, but he even said I should never have surgery... He then proceeded to look in my file at the computer eye tests and said... Everything looks good. I said don't you want to examine my eyes and he said... The tests say it all. During my surgery, I remember after he lasered my eyes and they were closed it was if someone turned off the lights - I could tell even with my eyes closed everything was blurry. After surgery was finished he said, how are you seeing, I said everything is really blurry and he said give it a few minutes. He then examined my eyes and he looked very, very nervous...he spent about 3 minutes examining them and I told him everything was still blurry. He said within a few hour it would clear up; it did, but my vision was still blurry and I needed more light to see everything. -prior to surgery, I was very sensitive to light and had to wear sunglasses-. They gave me sunglasses after the surgery and said it might be bright outside - I was actually able to take the glasses off and everything was darker than when I came in -no sensitivity - very odd-. Anyhow, went back the next day for checkup. There was a woman in the waiting room who couldn't open her eyes and said she couldn't see anything but blurriness. Apparently, she had the surgery a month prior and then went scuba diving and now was unable to see anything -no one told her she couldn't go scuba diving-. Also, I was complaining I couldn't see well and they rushed me into the examination room so no one would hear me complain. After the exam they told me I saw 20/25 and it would probably get better - I said you are kidding me. I can see the letters but they're ghosted, blurred, dark, etc. Dr (b) (6) assured me it would get better.

I said the right eye was worse. He then gives me enhancement on left eye because, he says the right eye is too close to 20/20 - I said again, you've got to be kidding?

1693406,2010-05-13,"I don't remember the exact date of the surgery, but fall of 2000 is about right. I had lasik in both eyes. One is fine but the other is not. I had astigmatism and somehow during the surgery, the laser actually created a 'divot' in my cornea. This has created the effect of still having astigmatism in that eye, though in the reverse: rather than a bulge or warping outwardly, it is a warping inwardly. A later surgery was performed about 5-6 years later to correct this but it did not. As a result, along with the sudden onset of presbyopia immediately following surgery, I've never actually been completely independent of glasses. I also immediately experienced the need for a very brightly lit environment for me to see well enough and, as the day progresses, I need stronger and stronger reading glasses and more and more light. As a result, it is difficult to consider a prescription glasses remedy since, at any given time of the day, I need a different corrective strength. It has created a cross-eyed, strained feeling if I go without them when doing any kind of close to mid-distance work or reading. I can, however, Drive ok, especially if I close the one eye. Over all, while I was aware of possible over or under correction, I was expecting to be rid of the astigmatism. While I knew that presbyopia could be accelerated, it was not explained or expected that it would be immediate.

1758042,2010-07-09,"In my case, it was not the product, but the protocol that caused permanent probleMs. I used a well respected lasik center that contracted with my local optometrist. I was evaluated in (b)(6) 2007 and told I was a perfect candidate for monovision lasik correction. For 6 months, my optometrist closely followed and examined my eyes and the stability of corneas. On (b)(6) 2008, the optometrist did the pre-op, including a cycloplegic exam, and faxed the consensus prescription to the lasik center. Unfortunately, there ""was a mix-up"" in the front office, and the wrong numbers were programmed for my procedure. For the past 2 1/2 years, I have struggled with distorted vision - and have tried over 12 pairs of glasses, 4 pairs of contact lenses, and finally sent to a specialist in reverse geometry lenses. My vision is still a challenge. At this point, the corneal tissue left is approx 430 microns. The original surgeon who preformed the surgery admits that the wrong prescription was programmed - and he did not verify the prescription with the referring optometrist; nor did he do an evaluation hiMself of my eyes at any time - pre or post surgery. Although I have seen 3 specialists since the experience and they concur that any future lasik treatment would not be advisable, the original doctor is adamant that a simple ""enhancement' would be all that I would need to achieve adequate/clear vision. -the doctor nor the center has performed any tests or exaMs-. The products, to the best of my knowledge, were state of the art and worked as programmed. The disaster resulted in the doctor not using the correct prescription for my eyes. We are now in litigation - and I'm finding that the ""system"" is constructed to protect the doctor. There is no dispute that the wrong procedure was performed, but the surgeon contends that correction would be simple and that he is not responsible for the mistake. Does the fda allow this type of protocol to exist - where a doctor can perform laser surgery on a pt without ever having actually examined the pt? - or not verifying records with the optometrist who performed all exaMs for 6 months prior to surgery?

You get no where when you complain about a bad outcome with this surgery, because they can't fix you. What this surgery has turned into is shameful.

It works like this, everyone is to blame for the wrongdoing, but you can't get your hands around no one to blame. As in lasik, it was approved by the fda, laser companies make faulty equipment, doctors are performing it, state medical boards rarely act, and you are caught in the middle crying ""help"", but there is no police to call to.

1784677,2010-08-02,"I am writing to add to the growing reports of long term adverse effects post lasik eye surgery. In 2002, I had lasik with the company boots in reading in (b)(4). I am a neurologist and should probably known better but believed the consent process would be similar to that of operations carried out in the (b)(4). Whilst I accepted a small risk of visual aberration -halos etc- there was never at any time mention of a risk of permanent Dry eyes. I suffered severe painful Dry eye requiring punctal occlusion immediately post op which lasted for around 3 months. I had no preceding history of Dry eye and no risk factors -male & otherwise well on no medications-. Dry eye symptoMs then improved for around 18 months before I started having bouts of severe eye pain lasting a few days or a week or two. However, I have now had severe Dry eye pain continuously for a year which has been devastating. I am in the medical profession and hence seen numerous ophthalmologists and tried all the usual treatments without any success -plugs/Drops/compresses/omega-3/steroid Drops etc-. The symptoMs have ruined my quality of life at a time when I should be enjoying a new family and successful career. Instead I have become clinically depressed requiring high doses of antI-depressants -with no prior history of any depression- due to chronic -eye- pain. I have been near suicidal with the usual issues -guilt, anger, pain, despair- and cannot at present see how I can continue to function at work for very much longer. Lasik has converted a vigorous, academically and professionally successful physician and young father into a depressed and introverted pt who fears for the future and a life of chronic eye pain. Whilst my individual case is of itself anecdotal that is the real scandal here. There appears still no robust data on the incidence of permanent life altering adverse events post lasik and it is clearly not in the interest of the providers of this surgery to collect this data or make it explicit. However, it would be a relatively simple audit to conduct given the huge numbers of people who have under gone this surgery - a random mailing of only a fraction of a percent of those having had surgery over the last 10 yrs would provide crucial data on the true incidence of permanent adverse events on which people could then make some form of an informed consent. The second issue is the importance of requiring consent to highlight the severity of potential adverse events, even if these are rare. I for one -and I suspect most/many others- would not have had the procedure if I had known there was any chance of a chronic pain condition. Young adults in the prime of their life are having elective surgery with the risk of potentially life altering adverse events for which there is little therapy. Post lasik Dry eye is a completely different ball park from age related aqueous deficiency Dry eye -both in terMs of associated pain and relative resistance to the usual therapies despite what ophthalmologists involved with lasik continue to suggest. The fact that those consenting pts to lasik are financially motivated makes it even more important that non-biased audit and regulation of this surgery is carried out. Sadly is suspect given another 5-10 yrs, we will have a generation of refractive surgery pts whose life has been de-railed/destroyed by lasik complications, a generation of doctors and companies that have profited from the unchecked/unregulated proliferation of this surgery and a group of regulators who will look back on the fiasco perhaps to consider whether the pts best interests have really been served in the way this surgery has been introduced and allowed to escalate unchecked and unregulated. For myself, I do not know what the future holds but a single uninformed decision at the age (b)(6) has wrecked my quality of life and I urge you to move to collect data on longterm risks without further delay and to regulate/standardise the consent process of this procedure in light of this data.

I experience double vision, blurry vision, weird focusing probleMs with movement or near-to-far, headaches, and Dry eyes all the time. My left eye - I can see, but it is inferior to contacts, only with good light when not experiencing the other probleMs. My right eye - has never been clear. The right is always blurry near or far and, I experience more probleMs with double vision and Dryness etc. I have gone back several times for examination as to my blurriness, etc and am told there is nothing they can find. It has been almost a year now with no resolution. I continue to use eye Drops -their suggestion- often which do not give any real relief to the probleMs I experience and advil doesn't help the headaches as they are caused by weird focusing issues that make me dizzy and tired.

1876219,2010-10-08,"I am the parent of two (b)(6) children who use one touch ping pumps. The ping meter remote and the insulin pump are designed to work together as a system by pts, in this case, pediatric pts with two ping users in the house, we have two onetouch ping meter remotes. The meters remotes are the same color, design and do not appear from the documentation to support user identification by name, the remote screens via software customization. Short of the serial numbers, these remotes are indistinguishable. In a multI pump household, the indistinguishable remotes and lack of in device personalization presents a strong possibility of confusion and the very real possibility of one child entering an insulin dose that is delivered to the other's pump. This would require that both the confused pumps and remotes be in common transmission and reception range. That happens at regular times, such as at a family meal. It is noteworthy that insulin pumps used to infuse insulin for meals. In fact, insulin pumps are designed for use in conjunction with almost all incidences of the consumption of carbohydrates. So the use of pumps at every family meal is to be expected. Labels, stickers and skins can all wear off or be removed. Customization of the home screen of the remote / meter with the user name would allow clear positive identification of who's pump the remote controls. Onetouch suggest that users check the serial number of the pump that can be displayed on the meter. Those numbers are long, not intuitive and potentially difficult for a pediatric pt to remember. The process of calculating and administering an insulin bolus involves an array of number; blood glucose, carb count, insulin to carb ratio and insulin on board to name a few. These numbers have the potential confusing the recall of the serial number. Hyperglycemia may exacerbate the risk. Linda gonder-frederick, phd et al demonstrates in the article cognitive function is disrupted by both hypo- and hyperglycemia in school-aged children with type 1 diabetes: a field study, diabetes care, june 2009, that hyperglycemia effects the cognitive function of school age children. Hyperglycemia require more insulin than would otherwise be infused as a correction bolus. However, at the time, more insulin is needed ability may be impaired and the potential confusing the recall of the serial number increases. Were this confusion of remotes used to operate pumps to happen, there is a very real possibility of excessive insulin delivery. Animas is aware of the risks of excessive insulin delivery. The phrase that is used repeatedly in the ping owner's booklet highlighted, is ""can result in serious injury or death"". Section iI, of the owner's booklet titled onetouchping meter remote, pages 107 - 126 details setting up the onetouch ping meter remote. Page 109 specifically speaks to the device home screen. Pages 114-118 address customization. In repeated readings I was unable to identify any customization of the onetouch ping meter remote that would facilitate naming or other easily understood personal identification of the user on the home screen or via customization settings. Use of remotes for different pumping pts in the same household represents a potential serious risk as designed. Dose or amount: varies, frequency: with meals, route: sq.

He told me that the condition was developing naturally and I had no contraindications to the operation. The initial thickness was 500 um. However, I do have concerns with this conclusion. There are numerous reports of this complication after lasik even with the initial cornea. It is also very suspicious that this condition developed only on one operated eye an not on another one. It makes me think that this is a complication of the operation. Please, if possible, provide me with info on how to find out the reason of keratoconus or keratectasia. I would also like to know what next options for treatment for me are. Professor (b)(6) suggested cross-linking collagen, but honestly I do not have trust in that clinic anymore and do not want to risk my health. The clinic refused all responsibility, both moral and material to treat me. Thank you. I would appreciate your help. Sincerely, (b)(6).",Ectasia

Within hours after the procedure, she experienced extreme discomfort and it was painful to open her eyes and had difficulty sleeping due to pain. The pain was primarily a sensation of extreme Dry eyes with burning. The pain improved slightly after one month, but the Dry eye sensation was still severe. Over the last year, the discomfort of Dry eye has shifted to photophobia or extreme sensitivity to light. Over the last year, she finds extended reading, computer work, and even going outside on a bright day intolerable. She wears sunglasses almost constantly, even indoors and at night since normal lighting makes her very uncomfortable. She has been diagnosed with corneal neuralgia which is a form of complex regional pain syndrome -assumed that this nerve disorder developed secondary to the lasik procedure. She has a degree in biomedical engineering and was working for several years prior to the procedure. She has been unable to work since the procedure since her primary function was using spreadsheets or programming on a computer. This has been devastating to our life and we are currently under the care of pain mgmt with little to no improvement.

I was never a good candidate for the procedure. The fda's only contraindication for the procedure is not to leave a corneal residual bed less than 250 microns. I started with a 500 micron cornea and had a -8.00 diopter correction that left about a 280 micron corneal bed. The treating surgeon and 2nd opinion don't even want to try an enhancement via lasik but via (b)(6) which risks corneal haze because of the thinness of the cornea. My preop pupil size was 8mm. With the correction needed and my pupil size, my night vision disability was guaranteed. The visx laser is only approved for an optical treatment zone of 6mm with an 8mm blend. The surgeons make you sign a huge consent form that guards them against litigation but they otherwise truly fail to inform the pt of their risks. The fda must have more stringent criteria for the indications of this procedure. This is an elective procedure but truly a medical procedure. This is being treated like a cosmetic procedure. There are too many eye disorders that are being created by overindicating high risk pts. The public needs to be protected. I am a physician and surgeon. I know that it does not matter what you post on your web site with regard to risks. Even a relatively safe procedure can be risky if performed on the wrong pt. Pt selection is crucial. The criteria for undergoing lasik needs to be more stringent with regard to pt selection. Moreover, the fda is too focused on visual acuity with regard to evaluating success.

Since these outcomes characterize the adverse affects that I experienced, and since there was no clinical f/u from Dr, nor the fda, despite the fact it was still considered experimental at the time of my procedure, I felt I should at least self-report. In addition to chronic and now nearly untreatable Dry eye, I find my vision is frequently cloudy, and my night vision has continued to be degraded. Additionally, and perhaps related to the lasik procedure, I have had two vitreous detachment events in the past two years. One in each eye.

2003547,2011-02-19,"I had lasik on (b)(6) 2010, at (b)(6). The surgery was performed by Dr. (b)(6) and the ophthalmologist that performed my pre-surgery evaluation was Dr. (b)(6). The day after the procedure my vision was 20/70 according to the snellen acuity test. My vision was extremely blurry and distorted. I was not told what my visual acuity was, and was allowed to Drive for over a week before being given a new eye glasses prescription. Legal vision in (b)(6) is 20/30 or 20/40. I was told each time by Dr. (b)(6) that I am a slow healer and to give it time. I was suffering from multiple images in each eye and vision that would fluctuate greatly throughout each day. At night, the halos, starburst, and multiple images were much worse. A few months or so, after the first lasik surgery I consulted Dr (b)(6)- for a second opinion. He spent roughly two hours working with me and was unable to correct my vision. His words were that the outcome was not catastrophic like a plane crash, but more like the landing gear just broke off. He had concerns that the shape of my cornea was changing throughout the day. I made two additional visits to Dr. (b)(6) about a week later, so he could check my eyes twice within the same day, once in the morning, and once later in the day. My vision was fluctuating throughout the day. Dr (b)(6) mentioned that cross-linking may help and that a new procedure would possibly be available in 6-8 months. Dr (b)(6) also mentioned that higher order aberrations were probably responsible for my poor vision. Unsatisfied with Dr (b)(6) opinion, I sought a third opinion from another ophthalmologist, Dr. (b)(6), who had handled my vision for about 4 years prior to me having lasik. He too was unable to correct my vision and mentioned that higher order aberrations were affecting my vision. I continued follow up appointments with Dr. (b)(6) due to multiple vision issues. In the first half of (b)(6) 2010, I was taken to the (b)(6) hospital by my father and wife to be evaluated for depression the night after I almost took my own life. I was taken to the (b)(6) facility and kept for the night for observation and released the next day. On (b)(6) 2010, I had a second lasik surgery also performed by Dr. (b)(6) as he seemed confident that he could correct my vision. The night of this procedure, I was able to see better than I had in the previous 7 months. The next day at my follow up appointment after the bandage contacts were removed my vision immediately became blurry. My vision continued to fluctuate again after this procedure and about 5 days after the enhancement surgery, severe double vision returned in my right eye and multiple images have since reappeared in both eyes. Prior to the second surgery, I had not had two follow up appointments where my vision was stable. I was unaware of this at the time I had the second surgery. I requested a copy of all of my records from Dr. (b)(6) office and my wife picked them up. The records were incomplete and there was no mention of my repeated complaints of multiple images, halos, starbursts, etc in my file. In the early part of (b)(6) I visited with a general physician with my wife to seek help for my severe depression. I was prescribed zoloft which I have taken daily since then with little relief. Near the end of (b)(6) 2011, I was referred to Dr (b)(6). He explained that my corneas were healthy and not scarred, but due to the amount of flattening that had occurred due to correction of my high myopia (-7.50 each eye contact rx) that stray light was causing the issues I was seeing. In addition to the flattening of my corneas, the size of my pupils were also contributing to my vision issues. He told me not to have any additional surgeries. On (b)(6) 2011, I had another visit with Dr. (b)(6) who spent about 1.75 hours and was also unable to correct my vision. He too mentioned that the amount of flattening of my cornea contributed to my vision issues. As of (b)(6) 2011, I still suffer from poor, frequently fluctuating vision during the day. I see multiple images in each eye and this only becomes worse and more apparent at night. At night I suffer from severe depression when I am out. The starbursts leave rays of light that project from every illuminated object to me and don't disappear until the original light source has been obscured. When cars are behind me, the headlights in my rearview mirror allow the starbursts to extend beyond the mirror and they obstruct my view through my windshield. Nighttime issues have only become worse and daytime vision is poor as well. This completely unnecessary surgery has robbed me of everything that I once enjoyed. I feel terrible for what my wife has been through as she tries to support me through this. I feel deceived by the surgeon and the doctor who performed my pre-operative evaluation. The risks were minimized and the fact that the surgery was performed in plain view of the lobby of facility gave the appearance that this was a trivial surgery with no real risks. This could not have been further from the truth as I have found. This procedure has completely ruined the last 11 months of my life and left me with little to look forward to each day.

Nowhere in the previous documentation from Dr. (b)(6) does he mention that corneal ectasia can occur as a result of lasik surgery.

2037665,2011-03-29,"Had lasik performed at (b)(6) in (b)(6) on (b)(6) 2010. After my procedure, my night sight was very foggy, large halos, large starbursting, and degraded vision in dim lighting. Pupils were not measured pre-surgery, and I didn't find out until after I started noticing probleMs. My pupils after surgery were measured at 8.5 mm and the optical zone used was 6.5 mm, transition 1.25 mm and blend zone out to 9 mm. Below is a letter I wrote to the medical director there. Mr. (b)(6), I am writing you today to ask for a little help. So far I still have massive starbursting, glare, loss of contrast in dim light, and ghosting just to name a few. In my pre op visit, my pupils were never measured with the colvard pupillometer like when I had them remeasure them in (b)(6). In fact I don't ever recall them being measured. It's hard to believe that on my charts they are said to be 6 mm but when I had them remeasured in fact they were over 8 mm which explains why all my vision probleMs are at night and in poor lighting when my pupil dilates. Its really not rocket science to understand that. Even my regular ophthalmologist said that my pupils are really big and another ophthalmologist I just recently saw measured my pupils at 8.6 mm. He told me that lasik should have never been performed on me because of the large pupils. So far I haven't gone out anywhere with my kids at night. I've been stuck inside my house because of the night time disturbances. My wife has to take them everywhere at night because it gets hard to Drive. The alphagan p Drops work sometimes but then tend to lose effectiveness over a few nights. I know that there is ""research"" that says that pupil size doesn't matter and all that, but most of it is ""independent research"" which pretty much means that it's worthless information. I was even told by staff that my pupils dilate past the treated area and it will go away when I get older. I'm not going to wait 10-15 years to play the let's wait and see game. This has directly effected my income, quality of life and mood. The staff have been nothing but nice to me so I'm not complaining about that. My next step I'm going to take to solve my issues is having a minI-scleral lens made to correct the night time issues. I've already been to an appointment with Dr. (b)(6) in (b)(6) to be fitted for some contacts to wear at night at the cost of (b)(6). I could have an enhancement for my left over prescription of -.50 in my left eye but to take the risk of being overcorrected and then trading one problem for another one I've pretty much talked myself out of that. Would it help with my night issues? No. Unless they could enlarge the optical zone, but that's another surgery and no guarantee. Last time I checked I only have one set of eyes to work with and they are how I view the world. I've tried wearing a contact lens and glasses but they don't help with the night issues, so another surgery wouldn't help. I would like a little help on paying for these lenses that way I can get back to a normal life and enjoy night time activities, but I doubt that will happen. I can only wish. My other question I have are: if pupil size doesn't matter, why are they administering a Drug that constricts pupils after refractive surgery? Just in my opinion, you cannot acknowledge the reality of ""night myopia"", which affects unoperated eyes with large pupils, and at the same time, deny that pupil size is unimportant in lasik. Night myopia is real, and large pupil-related night vision probleMs after lasik is real. Thanks for you time. Thanks, (b)(6).",Halos; Starbursts; Glares; Night Issues

My wife's mother was murdered when she was younger and her father was never really there for her. Now she is losing her husband too because I am losing the ability to cope with my vision. I am also afraid that you (fda) do not receive reports of negative lasik outcomes, because the report format on the following pages asks for info that most individuals do not have or is not applicable to a negative lasik event. A simplified format would improve pt responses. On (b)(6) 2010, I had my first lasik consultation with (b)(6), at (b)(6). At this consultation after all screening was completed I spoke with Dr (b)(6) and was told I was a candidate for lasik. I spoke to Dr. (b)(6) about my concerns of halos, starbursts, higher order aberrations and other vision complications that I had read about. I asked him specifically if I would have any of these issues and he stated that they would be no worse than what I currently experience at my prescription with contact lenses. I was also told that this is no longer an issue with the latest procedures. I did not have any noticeable vision issues prior to having lasik, I also asked Dr. (b)(6) if there were differences between the outcomes using a laser or the micro-keratome to cut the cornea flap. He stated that he uses the micro-keratome as it is more economical because an additional laser is not needed and that the results are the same. I have since found that micro-keratomes are more likely to cause striae which are present in my corneas now after the procedures. I had my pre-lasik appointment on (b)(6) 2010. At this appointment I signed the informed consent and further discussed my additional concerns with Dr. (b)(6). One of my additional concerns was listed in the consent form and discussed the eyes being more susceptible to injury after lasik. This was a big concern for me as I was an amateur boxer and was training for the (b)(6) as a personal goal of mine. I do not remember exactly what was said to me by Dr. (b)(6), but it must have been to the effect that it would be ok to continue boxing after the procedure as I went through with the procedure and would not have otherwise as competing was a very important goal for me. I also expressed this concern to Dr. (b)(6) (surgeon that performed both the lasik and lasik re-treatments at Dr. (b)(6) office) prior to the first surgery and was told it would not be an issue. I have also found that the fda website states you are probably not a good candidate if you participate in contact sports and boxing is listed first on the list. I also spoke to Dr. (b)(6) about a statement that lasik is to ""reduce your dependence on glasses or contacts"" and told him that if there was a real risk that I could still need contacts after the procedure that I was not interested. Again, I do not recall exactly what his response was, but I went through with the procedure, so I must have been left with little doubt there would be any issues. On (b)(6) 2010, I had the first lasik surgery on both eyes. Prior to the procedure I asked Dr. (b)(6) if this procedure would have any impact on my participation in boxing and he said no. He went on to explain that a boxing glove was a big, blunt object and it would not damage my eye after the surgery. I was unable to ask the surgeon (Dr. (b)(6)) any questions until after I had taken the valium which is troublesome. The valium greatly reduced my anxiety about the procedure which may have also led me to backing out once I had a chance to speak further with the surgeon as this is the first time I have had an opportunity to ask the surgeon any questions. On (b)(6) 2010, this was my first follow up appointment. I Drove to this appointment, as I was told the day of the surgery I would be able to see well enough to Drive. At this appointment I told the Dr (different doctor I had not previously met) that I was unable to see well and was scared Driving to my appointment.

My vision would then decline throughout the day and all of the multiple images, blurriness, halos, and starbursts would increase. Dr. (b)(6) was never able to explain why this would occur.

I have asked my ophthalmologist and others involved in treating my condition and they all said emphatically that there is no connection between the two. I found on the web that it can be one of the outcomes in a small amount of cases.

I talked to (b)(6) and he said lasik would be a great choice for me being that my prescription was so low (-2.5d). I did not go in for lasik, I went to see where my eyesight was. It was right at 20/40-20/50. I was assured by (b)(6) that I would be 20/20 and more likely 20/15 after lasik surgery. I scheduled surgery for (b)(6) 2009. I was told to be there at 1pm. I showed up at 1pm and was given informed consent papers to fill out by myself without anyone there to explain anything I might not understand. I did not sign the prk portion because I had no idea what prk was. There were many people there and I asked how many lasik surgeries were taking place-30 in 3 groups of 10. I thought this was too many and wanted to leave but my ride had left. Dr. (b)(6) was the surgeon and we were the #2 group. I was #7 which meant #17 of the day. I went into the surgical suite and they taped my left eye shut. Dr. (b)(6) then cut a flap in my right eye using a microkeratome of unknown manufacturer. He had me stare at the laser (a nidek ec5000) and performed lasik on my right eye. When he tried to put the flap back down he uttered a profanity and the mood quickly changed. The microkeratome had cut wrong. He worked for 15 minutes on the flap using the nidek ec5000 as a spot welder and then putting in a bandage contact. He then told me that he was changing the left eye to prk and looked at my informed consent paper. He made me sign the paper even though I told him that I did not know what prk was and to stop. He put a pen in my hand and said I know you can't see but try and sign. He told me that prk was the same as lasik just a different name. I signed the paper, I could not see. He then performed prk on left eye after the numbing Drops had worn off. I screamed in pain for 30 seconds while my epithelium was debrided without a local anesthesia and then (b)(6) had me stare at the nidek ec5000 laser and put a bandage contact in that eye also. He looked at my eyes with a slit lamp and sent me on my way. Total time for both eyes 35 minutes, and I came out of there looking like I had been in a fist fight. I knew something was wrong that night and called (b)(6) and was told that the pain, uncontrollable tearing and bad vision was normal. On my follow up appointment (b)(6) 2009 I was told that there had been a problem cutting the flap and they were going to watch that eye very carefully. On (b)(6) 2009, (b)(6) made a special visit from (b)(6) to look at my prk eye because after 10 days my epithelium had not even become to come in. It was supposed to be healed over in five days.

My prk eye was overcorrected to +.5d I was told by (b)(6) but that didn't explain the double vision, starbursts at night and generally bad vision. My vision was much worse than before surgery and my Dry eye was unbearable. My left (prk) eye was worse and I had to use wetting Drops every half hour.

Before surgery wearing glasses, I had great vision both up close and at distance. If I needed very close vision, I would take my glasses off to see. After surgery I now have double vision. My left eye and right eye are not equal in vision. I was told my brain would adjust to this discrepancy. After a year there has been some getting used to this double vision, but at distance especially there is a blurriness on the right side of my field of vision all of the time. The only time the vision is adequate is when I am outside during bright sunlight. In the early morning, early evening, during rain storMs or fog and night time my vision is fuzzy. Lights such as headlights and streetlights have glare, ghosting, haloes and starbursts effects. I had to get glasses for distance to wear especially at night, but even with better vision from the glasses the haloes and starbursts are still present.

This eye pain I can only describe as feeling like someone jammed an ice pick into my eye, and the accompanying ""suicide headache"" is equally severe and appropriately named. There really is hardly an aspect of life that has not been scorched due to lasik. We have no idea how precious our eyes are until they are destroyed. I was told by one psychologist that he considered my ptsd situation to be ""worse than that of someone who was buried alive who survived"", because the visual reminders of the trauma that continue to be trauma are there before my eyes every waking moment of my life. Measurable physical damage to my eyes from lasik: corneal ectasia -also called ""kerectasia"" or ""keratectasia""- - lasik induced thinning and weakening of the cornea, causing the cornea bulge forward due to the intraocular pressure pressing out on the thinned out cornea. This can eventually burst the cornea, necessitating corneal transplants; decentered ablations - causes visual distortions that you cannot even imagine unless you have studied optics; ablation zones that are too small relative to the pupil as it dilates in low light situations resulting in the same visual distortions just mentioned; higher order aberrations - I imperfections in the cornea -peaks and valleys rather than a smooth corneal surface- that prevent light from focusing directly on the retina causing visual disturbances like starbursts, halos, optical illusions, etc.; decreased contrast sensitivity- impairs depth perception; corneal neuropathy -causes depilating pain in eye and head. Neurologists sometimes refer to these headaches as ""suicide headaches"" because the severity is so great the suffers often contemplate suicide to stop the pain. Corneal scarring; irregular corneal distortion; irregular astigmatism; lasik flap which never heals - allows the stromal layer of the cornea to be exposed to outside elements which nature had never intended; additionally, over the years my visual acuity has regressed to almost it's pre-lasik point of 20/80 and 20/200 - lasik doesn't even permanently eliminate the need for glasses or contact lenses. This regression takes place over varying amounts of time for different pts, and has not been studied because the lasik industry knows exactly what it will find. The unethical, malignant, narcissist lasik surgeons, staff at (b)(6), laser manufactures, and the rest of the lasik industry that shamelessly peddle and perform this barbaric and always - 100% of the time- detrimental procedure should have their licenses revoked, their businesses shut down, and commercial, civil, and criminal charges should be brought against them. Class action lawsuits should be filed as well. What is the fda doing about this issue that they have known about for a decade? Why have they not responded to (b)(6) formal petition calling for an end to lasik? May the laws of karma be enforced on all knowingly involved. Lasik injured pts families are significantly affected. I'm just too tired to write about this now. They should have the right to sue the lasik industry for all that they lost.

2578614,2012-05-12,"I have had two lasik surgeries performed at (b)(6). The optometrist was (b)(6), od and the ophthalmologist was (b)(6), md for both surgeries. The timeline for the surgeries is: (b)(6) 2010 initial consultation with (b)(6), od (b)(6) 2010 pre-lasik measurements taken (b)(6) 2010 first lasik surgery both eyes performed at (b)(6), md (b)(6) 2010 lasik treatment surgery (both eyes) performed at (b)(6), md. On (b)(6) 2010, I received a written price quote for ""custom"" lasik. They did not perform custom lasik custom vue. I have copies of my operative reports indicating I received ""conventional"" lasik in (b)(6) 2010. This is fraud! Furthermore, using word combination like ""custom lasik"" when the svs provided are custom vue lasik or a conventional lasik is misleading and deceptive. I was not a candidate for lasik due to my active participation in boxing. (b)(6), od and (b)(6), md were both informed of my participation in boxing prior to performing the surgeries. I would not have signed the informed consent had Dr (b)(6) indicated that it would no longer be safe. Dr (b)(6) also assured me that continuing to participate in boxing would be safe. Dr (b)(6) and staff did not maintain accurate records of my medications. At a later date, I requested that (b)(6), od pull my records to review them with me and he would not, even though the computer was within arMs length. (b)(6), od and (b)(6) md provided false or misleading info on their websites. (b)(6) website (b)(6) specifically states lasik is a cutting edge procedure for improving vision and getting rid of glasses or contacts forever. (b)(6), od orally provided statistical data that directly correlated with custom vue results from his website. Their website has changed and the address is no longer valid, (b)(6). The title stated ""updated customvue results"" in large, bold lettering, however, the small print at the bottom of the chart states the data is from 2004. This data excluded my degree of required correction, and therefore, did not provide any indication of what I could expect as an outcome. Lasik procedures induce higher order aberrations. Many pts have 20/20 visual acuity, but suffer from double vision, halos, starbursts, etc that significantly reduce their vision quality. Advertising success in terMs of visual acuity 20/20, 20/40, etc is deceptive. I was a high risk pt likely to experience night vision issues including: halos, starbursts, and multiple vision due to my high degree of correction and large pupil size. I was not informed of this until after the first surgery. I asked (b)(6) directly if I would have any of the night vision issues listed in the informed consent because I was scared of having damaged night vision as I spend a significant amount of time in dim or dark lighting conditions. (b)(6), od informed me that these side effects are no longer an issue with the latest procedures. Prior to lasik I did not have any vision issues in dim or dark lighting conditions. My pupils measured as large as 7.9 mm. I was given expired prescription eye medication by (b)(6), md and instructed to use the medication for six months before I would see an improvement. I was never previously diagnosed with a medical condition warranting the use of this medication, even though I had been seen by many optometrists and ophthalmologists prior to Dr (b)(6) giving me this medication. I have both the medications and the dated dosage instructions as evidence. I was given a prescription eye medication, pilocarpine, by (b)(6), md that was not intended for use outside of Dr (b)(6) partner, office. It was labeled ""for office use"" and did not have my name on the bottle or packaging. I have this medication and its packaging as evidence. This medication was prescribed to reduce my pupil size, because I was experiencing vision probleMs due to the high degree of correction and large pupil size. My vision was not stable at the time I received the second surgery. My vision fluctuated greatly throughout each day. The surgery has induced a significant number of vitreous floaters in both of my eyes that were not present prior to the surgeries. This side effect was not disclosed to me prior to either surgery. This was referred to as ""the fleas of everyone's vision"" by Dr (b)(6) when I discussed the issue with him. Floaters were not the fleas of my vision, but surgically induced damage to both of my eyes. Both surgeries were performed within view of the lobby. There was a seating area designated for spectators. This practice gave the false appearance that the surgery was safe and without risk. I was not informed prior to the first surgery that the corneal flap can be easily lifted during the first two years, and in many cases lifted after several years. This one sentence would have immediately caused me to decline the procedure. This was disclosed to me six months after the initial surgery, in the second consent form before my re-treatment. This is info that could reasonably cause a large population of potential pts, including myself, to decline having the surgery. The corneal flap does not ""heal"" in the same manner as the general population defines healed. For example, a healed cut on one's arm after surgery cannot be easily reopened for years following the surgical procedure. I would not have accepted this side effect under any circuMstance. The higher the attempted correction, the longer it takes the cornea to heal. This too would have caused me to decline the surgery. My wife and I had vacation plans shortly after my initial surgery date. An important vacation with my wife was ruined due to my poor vision. My quality of life has been destroyed because of a useless, elective surgery. My professional career as a mechanical engineer will be in jeopardy if my... I can provide electronic scans of the majority of my medical records including wavefront measurements, multiple hospitalization records for attempted suicide and depression, informed consent forMs from both lasik procedures, operative reports for both procedures, etc. Many iteMs are shown on my personal website (b)(6). Prior to lasik, I did not have depression or any other mental health related issues. I also did not have any vision probleMs before having lasik. I was healthy and actively participated in amateur boxing. My career was also going extremely well. Lasik has changed all of this and created a hardship for my wife and I. I have spent thousands of dollars as a direct result of lasik related complications to my vision and overall health. I have had continuous issues with my vision and have not had a single day of clear, normal vision since the first lasik surgery on (b)(6) 2010. I have to use alphagan p daily to reduce my pupil diameter to see better in dim/dark lighting conditions. I also have to use steroid eye Drops periodically to help resolve recurrent corneal erosions as a result of the lasik procedures. My contact lenses do not correct my vision and cost much more.

Six months later, I still have extremely bad night blindness and have severe impairment when trying to Drive at night. This is a significant impairment because I live in (b)(6) where it is dark much of the year. During my exam, Dr (b)(6)'s assistant measured my pupils in a dim room, not a dark room, at 8.0 mm. The assistant asked me how my night vision was, and I replied that it was excellent. When I asked if having large pupils would be a problem, I was told that the (b)(6) would actually improve my night vision. I was assured that none of the scary side effects on the informed consent forMs would happen to me, so I signed and I paid (b)(6) for the procedure, plus the cost of the exam, and then had the surgery two days later. The procedure seemed to go fine, but I immediately noticed that I had severe night blindness after the procedure. Six months later it still has not gotten better.

Dr (b)(6) said that he was extremely surprised that I was having issues because the (b)(4) procedure ""improves night vision"" in his words. On the phone, Dr (b)(6) explained that the laser treated 6.5 mm of my cornea, and then the wavefront treated the rest of my cornea all the way out to 8.0 mm. He also said that his records indicated my pupils were measured at 7.5 mm, not 8.0 mm. My suspicion is that my pupil dilates far beyond 8.0 mm at night, and the night blindness is caused by an undertreated area on my corneas. I feel that Dr (b)(6) was not conservative enough in his treatment of this pt. Dr (b)(6)'s suggestion was to perform a second lasik treatment on my eyes.

On (b)(6) 2010, (b)(6) of (b)(6) personally gave me a written price quote to have a custom lasik procedure performed at his facility. The price quote specifically listed the procedure as custom lasik. There was no mention of conventional lasik or any other procedure on this document. There was also no mention that the procedure could or would be changed w/o my consent. Multiple doctors who have reviewed my operative reports from (b)(6) 2010, have verified that I did not receive a custom lasik treatment. The conventional lasik treatment I recd on (b)(6) 2010, was performed w/o my knowledge or consent. The doctors responsible for my care and surgery were (b)(6) of (b)(6). The timeline of events does not support that both the optometrist and ophthalmologist were in agreement on the procedure that would be performed at time I was given the price quote specifying custom lasik. Therefore, I was given a quote that misrepresented the procedure I would receive, there was a gap in the documentation and communication between (b)(6) ensuring that I would receive the custom lasik procedure I was quoted to receive, or changes were made to my treatment plan w/o my knowledge or consent. Regardless, I did not receive the procedure I paid for. The following info should be provided and questions should be answered: Dr (b)(6) should provide a copy of either price quote that was distributed to me on (b)(6) 2010, or a copy of the price quotes that he or his staff were distributing during the time frame of (b)(6) 2010. This will indicate if Dr (b)(6) provided unique quotes custom vs. Conventional lasik to pts based on his assessment of their health, or if he provided a single version of the quote to all pts that only specified custom lasik as the procedure, indicating that pts, including myself, did not receive the procedures we expected to receive and paid for. The quote provided to me by Dr (b)(6) had a unique detail that I will disclose separately which could help indicate if the quotes provided by Dr (b)(6) in response to this complaint are indeed the same as provided to me on (b)(6) 2010. Did Dr (b)(6) have authority to specify which procedure I would receive as a pt custom lasik vs. Conventional lasik w/o Dr (b)(6)'s concurrence? If Dr (b)(6) had authority, how did he communicate to Dr (b)(6) that I was to receive custom lasik and not conventional lasik? Is there documentation of this communication? If Dr (b)(6) did not have authority to specify the procedure I would receive, why did he give me the price quote (b)(6) 2010 that specifically stated that I would receive a custom lasik procedure? What date did Dr (b)(6) agree on the procedure I would receive? Why did Dr (b)(6) perform a conventional lasik treatment when the quote I was given by Dr (b)(6) specified custom lasik? Why did they not communicate any changes to the treatment plan to me and request my consent prior to performing a procedure other than custom lasik? There was no valid reason for (b)(6) to deviate from the quoted treatment plan of custom lasik w/o my knowledge or consent. It was not as if this was a life saving procedure that would have warranted a deviation from the quoted procedure. This was a completely elective procedure with an indefinite amount of time to discuss potential options. Dr (b)(6) did not do this. (b)(6) deviated from the procedure I paid for w/o my knowledge or consent. My life altering decision to have surgery performed at (b)(6) was based off of info provided to me by (b)(6) that indicated I would receive custom lasik. (b)(6) and his staff have continually refused to provide to me with a copy of the price quote they gave me, as they were aware that the quote provided to me on (b)(6) 2010 specified custom lasik and this document will be presented as evidence against them.

3313897,2013-07-22,"I wish to report 21 post lasik/prk pts who developed a previously unreported, severely disabling and possibly permanent complication of the massive corneal nerve fiber axotomies performed during these procedures: it is an especially intense unrelenting form of neuropathic trigeminal pain including in many, painful photosensitivity. This pain had persisted 2 to 15 years at the time of the initial consultation. Because the suicide provoking intensity and unrelenting nature of the pain is masked by the typically normal appearance of these eyes and sometimes a significant delay in their onset, these symptoMs have been dismissed as exaggerated or imagined. To my knowledge, this complication has not been previously reported. Despite my paper having been vetted by two neuroscientist-clinician experts on neuropathic pain, the paper was summarily rejected by the journal of the academy of ophthalmology and journal of cataract and refractive surgery. In both cases it appeared that the reviewers were surgeons who currently perform this procedure. My suggestion that one of the reviewers be an expert in neuropathic pain was ignored by both journals. Because of my concern that these rejections may have been motivated by self-interest, I have posted the paper on the website of my nonprofit (b)(6) eye pain.

3360490,2013-09-11,"I had all laser lasik 8 months ago from lasikplus. Lasikplus glossed over the risks and recovery and did not provide accurate or thorough pre-lasik education. I was told the following: recovery period is 1-3 months with temporary starbursts that go away and temporary vision fluctuations that go away, the rate of under correction is 5%, cornea ectasia was briefly discussed with me and dismissed as a rare complication. This messaging is flawed: the flap cut by lasik never heals - this was not even mentioned to me. The true recovery period is much longer than 3 months, a realistic time-table was not provided to me. Starbursts were marketed to me as temporary but the reality is that they can be permanent and are not curable. Dry eye was not explained to me. There is no cure for Dry eye. The 5% under-correction rate is misleading in that it is only a part of the story. The other part is that you could be overcorrected, or with an induced astigmatism, or with eyes that are not the same prescription as each other - none of which was discussed with me. I was not adequately pre-screened for Dry eye nor was I educated about Dry eye pre-operatively. My pupil size was not discussed with me and its potential impact on vision was not reviewed with me. My near vision - reading vision - was not evaluated pre-operatively. The lasik manufacturer's literature was not provided to me. I was not consulted with regarding my other options such as prk, lasek, contact lenses, or glasses. I was not consulted with on my personal goals and reasons for having lasik to ensure that these were in-line with what is possible with lasik.

F/u surgery reduced this somewhat, so that the extra images are like ghost images, and I usually only notice 2 of them. Because I have large pupils and they did not increase the size of the flap to account for it, I get ""edge"" effects from the flap. This results in light diffraction. The effect is similar to looking through gauze. In bright conditions it can be quite pretty (my lawn sparkles like diamonds after the rain) but impairs my vision significantly (it's hard to see anything else while dazzled by a million diamonds) and impairs my ability to Drive. Every point of light is a starburst coming from a bright ""buckyball"", and there's the ghost images of them to deal with also. The effects are often so bright that it is exquisitely painful. Polarized glasses help somewhat, but can't be worn at night or in other low light conditions. In dim lighting, the gauze effect can make it difficult to focus on things, a walk through the woods becomes a walk through shades of green that I can't determine the distance to.

I am a physician and I was devastated to learn that there is no cure. I tried a hard gas permeable contact lens treatment which was horribly uncomfortable and did not improve my vision enough to be able to use my left eye. I finally was able to see my cornea specialist who performed the lasik and he agreed with the diagnosis and again said that this is very rare and that there are only case reports of this complication. I suspect this post-lasik complication occurs more frequently and it is just not reported within the community to make pts aware of this awful complication. For now, I have been referred to another specialist for ""prose"" contacts to see if this will improve the vision well enough. Apparently, a corneal transplant is not a good option as pts still require hard gas permeable contacts 40% of the time. Again - no good solutions to this very bad complication.

I cannot make our peoples faces in a dimly lit room as the lights overtake the whole area. I cannot see in a restaurant if there are chandeliers, wall sconces or even a candle on the table. All those light sources starbursts are so large they hide everything. When I enter a room that is lit differently from the one I was exiting, my eyes do not adjust like before. It takes many minutes for my eyes to get a minimal amount of focus. Before surgery, I could open a closet door or look into a kitchen cabinet and see what was in there. Now, it is pitch black. My eyes cannot make out any of the objects. I have to use a flashlight to see in a cabinet and the room lights are on. Additionally, during the day, my vision will fluctuate with 1 eye seeing clearly one day and the other eye the next. My right eye continues to see double vision randomly. At night, my left eye starbursts are about double the size of my right eye starbursts. My right eye starbursts already make a light size about 10 times the size of a normal light size. The normal pinpoint indicator light on many electronics that show on/off starburst to about size of volleyball. An average front porch light starbursts to about half the size of the door. The headlights on an average car cover the entire car. These are not the normal halos and glares that are described pre surgery or manageable as a side effect. These are starbursts combined with halos and glares that completely make night vision, low lighting vision and contrast vision inadequate for normal daily function. I have to put Drops in my eyes daily at dusk that shrink my pupils to get a few hours of night Driving possible. The Drops have their own side effects such as heavy eyelids and Drowsiness that still make Driving difficult. The Drops eventually wear off so I have to be sure to be home before that happens. They also take an hour to work, so if I lose track of time and do not realize that it has gotten dark outside, I have to stay put until the Drops begin working and I can Drive. I also put Drops in my eyes every morning and evening for Dry eye. My vision after lasik is worse than prior to lasik. I have had no improvement with night vision. I am not experiencing ""normal"" side effects as advertised. I am a mother of 3 children ages (b)(6) and I own a restaurant and (b)(6). My daily personal life and professional life is completely negatively affected as a result of lasik surgery. I can no longer perform normal daily tasks as I could prior to lasik surgery. I have seen a cornea specialist at wills eye in (b)(6), (b)(6) 2013 and my original ophthalmologist in (b)(6), (b)(6) 2014 with both telling me they don't know what is causing this, however, it obviously is a result of lasik as I did not have these probleMs before they have told me this is permanent and there is nothing they can recommend to improve this other that daily eyedrops at dusk to shrink my pupils. I have appointments with 2 other eye doctors in the near future to see if they have any suggestions or treatments to improve my vision.",Halos; Starbursts; Glares; Dryness; Night Issues; Pain; Flashes

I am an artist, and now I must do all my detail work during daylight hrs. I also have trouble distinguishing colors at night, especially if two or more colors are similar, such as a menu with brown lettering on beige paper. Tasks like grocery shopping are difficult because searching for iteMs causes eye strain after 20 mins or so, and my eyes become blurry and weak. I rarely read books anymore because my eyes become exhausted very quickly. The computer is not too bad because I have a huge screen and can adjust my distance as needed, and the brightness of the screen doesn't seem to make my eye tired too quickly. My laptop is a different story. I had to change the fonts to extra large, so nothing really fits on the screen. I also have little depth perception. I constantly run into coffee tables, knock over glasses and cups, and have to feel my way out of a movie theater.

So I had lasik surgery on the same day and the doctor persuaded me that the surgery was a true success. Unfortunately within a week, I started experiencing poor and blurry vision and severe Dryness in my eyes. I visited my doctor again and he assured me I was fine and did not need to worry, for what I was experiencing was normal and many patients don't see results immediately. He asked me to come for a regular visit which I did, but my condition continued to deteriorate and after 3 months ((b)(6) 2013) he did an additional lasik enhancement. The next few weeks (afer the lasik enhancement) my eye sight progressively got worse. I stated experiencing double vision and loss of vision sharpness in addition to Dry and poor eyes. After a couple of visits my doctor told me that I am suffering from ectasia and I have to undergo ""collogen cross linkage"" in order to stop further progression of ectasis and the results of this process comes after 3 to 6 months. So I had the collogen cross linkage in (b)(6) 2013 as advised by my doctor. I went for regular visits and waited for almost 5 months. I was really just hoping for a miracle but conditions just worsened. In (b)(6) 2014, I had to travel overseas with my husband, so before traveling, I sought a second option from another specialist; he told me that I am suffering from post-lasik corneal ectasia and my eyes are not healthy enough for a long travel. He met with my doctor (b)(6) ; who did my lasik, enhancement and collogen cross linkage and they decided I should undergo one more ""collogen cross linkage"" before travel. So, I had a second cross linkage on (b)(6) 2014 and a total of 2 lasiks, plus 2 cross linkages during that year's duration. The second cross linkage was a miracle for 2-3 weeks. I was really able to see clearly. No blurry, poor and no double vision. I was just suffering from severe Dry eyes which is ok compared to the other probleMs, but everything started up again after 2-3 weeks. Finally I started digging online for lasik complication, post lasik probleMs and ectasia. At the time of the first lasik, cornea thickness of my left eye was 479um (pupil center) 468 (thinnest local) and thickness of right eye was 474um (pupil center) and 460um (thinnest local). This is below 500 um of both eyes. I believe that I was not an ideal candidate for lasik. After three months, he performed an enhancement procedure as well, and made it worse. Thickness just before enhancement of left eye was 411um (pupil center and 399um (thinnest local) and thickness of the right eye was 425um (pupil center) and 413um (thinnest local). This clearly shows that my cornea was getting thinner and he just ignored it and performed the enhancement and ruined my life completely. Today, my vision is very poor, I am not able to see clearly, suffering from double vision, really Dry eyes, and cannot concentrate on anything.

After exposure for around two hours I start to experience a migraine type headache that obligates me to shut down and take a 2 hour sleep along with at least 800 milligraMs of ibuprofen to get rid of the pain. My military career is being seriously affected. My time and activities with my wife and children are being affected. I am forced to wear dark sunglasses all the time, indoors and outdoors. I have read of multiple similar cases like mine after lasik/prk and other eye surgeries.

I went to (b)(6) for a checkup, and they told me my eyesight required contacts. I told them I had lasik performed by them and that I was told at the time I purchased it that, it included lifetime corrections; but they told me they had no record of my surgery and that I was not a candidate for further lasik. It all seemed a bit strange to me. So I went to (b)(6) in (b)(6) for a second opinion. After a thorough eval the doctor wrote me a script that states ""post lasik ectasia or keratoconus"" and ""tx-collagen cross linking"" (a procedure he suggested). Needless to say, since that time I have been very worried, hoping my eyesight will not worsen; but I believe it has, and am now going back to get evaluated again and find out what I need to do to protect my eyesight. I am aware every minute of every day of my blurred vision and of the ""shadowy"" effect on everything I look at. It has affected my ability to work (I rely heavily on reading and being able to recognize people's faces) and has hurt my self-confidence, since my diminished vision is always on my mind. Now knowing what is going on, and reading about the potential side effects of actasia, this caused me no small amount of emotional duress and I wonder just how bad my eyesight that lasik can cause, I may just as well have stayed in soft contact lenses. I'm reporting this because I don't think anyone should have to go through this kind of anxiety and fear over their eyesight, having never been told by their doctor that such risks exist.

I was diagnosed with ""corneal ectasia"" due to lasik surgery. Dr (b)(6) and I tried contacting my doctor ( Dr (b)(6)) who performed this surgery to request my medical records so we can have a better understanding on how thin my corneal was before he performed lasik. Our request was denied. Dr (b)(6)'s office requested I make an appointment to come in to see him, and then called me one day before my visit to cancel. His office stated Dr (b)(6) didn't want to see me because he didn't want to interfere with new Dr/pt.

Since then, I've had serious eye strain issues that have triggered numberous neuromuscular probleMs in my head, neck, shoulders, arMs, and hands. In particular, because the artificial multI-focal lens installed in my cataract eye doesn't communicate fully with my natural lens in my other eye, I've had severe headaches, have potentially triggered cerebral spinal fluid pressure issues inside my head, and have developed an arthritic condition in my upper spine (c1-c3 vertebrae). The vision issues also trigger constant spasMs within my head, emanating from my left side/cataract eye with the artificial lens, that spasm muscles from my left temple, around my head, to my upper spine, which in turn creates pinched nerves that cause numbness in my left arm and hand. The csf pressure issues have also created constant ringing in my ears, and led to my having to take large daily doses of diamox (1,500 mg/daily), in order to lessen the effects of the csf pressure, which are: nausea, intense pressure in the left ear, intense pain along left side of head, and a general ""woozy headedness"" and fatigue that has been debilitating.

Had severe Dry eye for the next 6 months where it was almost imposible to keep my eyes open without pain and tears--impact at work. Lost a lot of light so that night vision and Driving at night became dangerous. Also seeing anything that was backlit like a person's face coming down a corridor was impossible then and still hard.

I was told that lasik would not affect my ability to have crystal lens or other vision improvements late and there was no mention of possible negative effects to cornea. All in all, not too bad but certainly not such a good idea either.

When I inquired into the potential side effects of the surgery, I was told that my vision would be blurry the day of the procedure and that my eyes would likely feel Dry for several days or weeks afterwards. I was not informed of any other potential side-effects. In the six months since the procedure, I have experienced various unanticipated and life-altering side-effects. These side-effects include: my low-light vision is terrible: I cannot distinguish between objects and everything appears ""grainy""; I am uncomfortable Driving at night or dusk; I see large ""starburst"" around any source of light; this effect is particularly pronounced around headlights and street lights; I see halos around soft or covered light sources, such as lamps; my eyes are no extremely sensitive to bright light; on sunny days I have to wear sunglasses, and I cannot look at a bright computer monitor for more than a few minutes at a time; I have frequent low-grain headaches behind my eyes, particularly when I spend more than a few seconds looking at an object very close or very far; I also get eye exhaustion, a phenomenon I had never before experienced; in which my eyes simply need to rest; this typically occurs in the late afternoon or evening; and I have severly Dry eyes, the one side-effect I had expected, though not six months after the procedure.

My vison is fundamentally impaired, and I am reminded of that impairment nearly every minute of every days.

I noticed when my pupils were dilated at my most recent appointment, when I Drove home to believe that my issues arise when my pupils are dilated (as is the case in low light, and was the case the day of that appointment).

I am very upset about the results and am continuously being told that I measure at 20/20 and got a good result. I assure you I did not get a good result and it seeMs that I am stuck with this vision. It is very frustrating. I sincerely regret ever having had lasik surgery and urge you to reconsider its approval.

Thirteen days after surgery I was examined by an eye doctor and was told both of the flaps had wrinkles and this was causing my vision probleMs. I was told wearing glasses will not be able to correct this problem. They can only correct my poor vision by lifting up the flap and repositioning it. While my boyfriend was waiting for me in the office another patient came in for her appointment for the exact same problem. The risks of this were not made clear to me and I'm very upset/frustrated.

Lasik, microkeratomes and excimer lasers are flawed to begin with but at the bare minimum need to be labelled as the high risk devices for which they are. On to the adverse events. Following lasik, I experience unremitting Dry eyes and pain in general. So much that I cannot go about my daily tasks because my eyes are always hurting and look the part too (bloodshot, glazed). My night-vision (low light conditions, Driving) has been severely hindered and compromised. The corneal flap created in lasik never heals and now that is another adverse event report just waiting to happen. My vision is now filled with floaters as a result of the invasiveness of the procedure and I am looking at a vitrectomy and cataract surgery in the future, not to mention an overall weakened eye in terMs of its health and biomechanical strength. Be these things as they may, just directly inform the public of them. I can honestly say that I was barely aware of the frequency and severity of the complications of lasik. This lack of info and misinformation is purposely crafted by these clinics who care not one ounce for pts whose eyes and lives they destroy. The fda and it's lax regulations are ineffective and insufficient in combating the false advertising and public perception of laser correction. I urge you, by all that is good in the world, from every fibre of my being and of the others injured by lasik, to issue a public health advisory and/or black box warning like so many before we have asked of you. I had to leave my job because my eyes hurt all the time and I can no longer look at a computer screen while maintaining customer service and my other job responsibilities ((b)(6)). My social life has completely eroded and my personal prospects have been lost. If I did not have the support of my family, there would be nothing to prevent me from falling into a deeper depression than I already am. Suicidal ideation is something that I am now all too familiar with. My life has completely deteriorated because my eyes have been severely damaged by a unnecessary and very much corrupt procedure and industry. And my life was good. I was happy. I did not ask for this, nor was I even aware that it could actually happen. Lasik has been the worst decision of my life and I regret it every day and surely will continue to regret until the day I die. I am (b)(6) as of this writing and by the way, the clinic considers me a success because I can roughly achieve 20/20 acuity, other complications be damned. I was 20/20 with my glasses of course so benefit has hardly been worth the risk. The fda held a lasik panel in april 2008 where numerous people, pts and professionals alike, told you everything you needed to know about lasik. Seven years later and nothing has changed. If you were to host a similar forum today, the testimonies would be the same, only in greater number and in greater detail. You conducted a quality of life survey with results published in october 2014 where ""disabling symptoMs were found in a significant numbers of pts"". How many eyes and lives must be destroyed before you do what is right and alert the public and black box this product? These ophthalmologists are not ethical. They have long departed the path of medicine and healing in search of financial gain and ego. And this is the root of the problem. Profit over pt welfare via indifferent laser surgeons. You could be an ideal candidate, a poor candidate, it makes no difference. They want you under the laser, out the other side so they get rich and an innocent person is needlessly compromised.

One year later, I have a residual +1.25d on the right eye and +1.5d on the left eye because of the insufficient program of ablation (better than getting a myopia though) and my treatment is not well centered around my pupil. This leads to a moderate double vision on the right eye, and a moderate triple vision on the right eye. Those symptoMs are visible in all conditions of light. I have halos and starbursts around lights in low light conditions, localized on the bottom of the lights because of the treatment which was received too low. It became way more difficult to Drive my night but still possible, lucky me when I read other testimonies. I also have lost a lot of contrast especially in low light condition. I also got Dry eyes, which is improved with Drops, but deteriorate the quality of my vision. I have to choose between seeing a little bit better but feeling bearable pain in the eyes and take the risk to damage my cornea, or losing 2 lines of bscva and ucva by using Drops.

Sadly, I got trapped by the satisfaction rate (around 97% they say) and the safeness that all surgeons and clinics show for this unnecessary surgery. The problem is that all those side effects are not taken into consideration. My surgery is considered a success for example. The biggest problem is that the importance of side effects are not well explained and the surgeons always say that they are temporary to make you feel safer, except they often don't: 50% of people get at least one of those (profanity) side effects temporarily, and more than 20% after six months or for ever. This does not include Dry eye. The amount of money at stakes makes a lot of surgeons greedy and practice without any honesty regarding the side effects that can easily be devastating for people's lives, even with a 20/70 vision seeing double makes you think of your mistake doing this surgery every single minute of your upcoming life. Right now I have almost no perspective of improving my vision, a retreatment one year after the first surgery is not worth the risk: possible epithelial growth and more severe Dry eye condition, not very good result with retreatment, that can even worsen the vision again etc. I probably lost forever the possibility to see well like before.

Night vision probleMs are getting worse all the time, specifically glare and low vision, in general. In addition, my cornea is very thin, which has multiple probleMs. One of my retinas is partially detached. Floaters have gotten so bad that my vision is rarely clear. And I am reaching the age where cataracts start. When I learned that I needed to have pre-lasik vision info in order to ensure that cataract surgery properly correct vision, I contacted the lasik doc and was told they do not keep records that long. A friend who had lasik at the same time as I did from the same doc recently had unsuccessful cataract surgery, she faces more surgeries.

My story - I had prk done in (b)(6) 2008. At the time, I was appx -9.00 with retinal lattice. The doctor said I was a "" perfect candidate for surgery"" ( I now know most patients are). Immediately after surgery, and to th present my vision was very cloudy, with ghosting; bad night vision due to hug halos around all lights and signs; my ""blended"" vision was never successful; computer screens and reading are difficult after the first 10 minutes; contrast between gray skies adn silver cars when Driving ( and also reading) is very diminished. Unsuccessful enhancements were tried, but in 2010, I was told my cornea healed incorrectly and there was nothing more to be done. I did not go back to this surgeon or clinic. Later, in 2010, my right retina detached, and in 2011 my left detached ( left was caught much sooner since I knew exactly what was happening). In each case, I did not have the scleral buckle surgery. After the detachments and to the present, I have huge floaters that compounded my laser complications. I see a retina specialist twice a year who always says everything looks ""good"" as far as the retina attachments go, but have limitation on many of my activities for fear of a repeat detachment. In 2014, I was diagnosed with a ""lasik induced"" cataract, for which they are putting surgery off due to my retinal issues so that eye is now becoming cloudier. ""lasik induced"" is th term used by some ophthalmologists, including two that I saw and one that currently markets lasik. I think this is due to the steroids that are commonly used post surgery for healing issues. I am very discouraged/depressed, but am trying to be more proactive regarding my care and hope for a new solution. I still feel the majority of the pain, ghosting, headaches, halos, nigh Driving and contrast issues are related to the healing of the prk and that a scleral might help. However I have been discouraged by my retina specialist from trying them. I continue to be amazed by how many ophthalmologists and optometrist will tell you not to risk refractive surgery for cosmetic reasons based on their experience with post lasik patient (not the lasik surgeons, of course), but the fda continues to let these surgeries go on. I believe at short term and long term risk to the patients. It is virtually impossible to ever hear of the risks in any ads (just spend an hour listening to talk radio in kansas city) or fly on an airplane and read about the usa greatest doctors, not until you sign on the dotted line, do they tell you what happens at ""other clinics."" why was my doctor not required to ever file a report with you about my complications (adverse effect?). What are considered ""adverse effects""? I am aware of other of his patients who had similar probleMs, and I cannot see that they ever were reported to the fda, either. (my surgeon only knew of my issues thru th fall of 2010, not the subsequent probleMs) filing and ""adverse report"" is not something that most patients would ever know about. I believe it has to be the responsibility of th clinic or surgeon who perforMs the procedure. I am quite certain thousands of complications must go unreported, so customers considering these procedures do not have a true picture of what can happen. The public cannot help but be uniformed of how truly debilitating the results can be for many people.

I decided to move forward with the procedure. Shortly after its completion and 2 days worth of excruciating pain, I went back in for my f/u. I was informed that the corneal flap did not heal correctly and they would have to go back in and smooth it out. This again, was an excruciating process. I had to do this two more times after the initial procedure. A week or so after the f/u surgery, I started to notice blurred vision, Dry eyes, light sensitivity, night halos, and most importantly floaters. During subsequent f/u visits, I was assured that these side effect were temporary and they would disappear within a few months. Here I am 3 years post surgery and all side effects are worst than ever. I still have constant Dry eyes requiring Drops sometimes 5-10 times a day. I still have light sensitivity, blurred vision, and horrible night halos which effects my Driving ability. All those side effects are bad enough, but far and away the worst are the floaters. These are small particles or proteins suspended in the vitreous fluid of the eye which makes it appear as if I'm looking through cobwebs or dirty glasses 24 hours of everyday. I voiced my concerns about these floaters many times to the surgeon and other doctors to which their reply was ""lasik cannot cause these floaters since they are in the fluid of the eye and the procedure does not effect the fluid"" of course, after the fact, I find out this is a complete lie. The suction that is used to hold the eye in place while the surgery is preformed causes such trauma that is common for retinal tests to take place suspending these proteins (floaters) in the vitreous. If I would have known this was a possible side effect, I would have never gone ahead with the surgery. These floaters are permanent and non-correctable. So it is something I will have to live with for the rest of my life. There are many other examples of these horrible side effects documented all over the internet. My eyesight it now permanently ruined, and I have to come to terMs with that.

This process took about 2 more days. I did go immediately to have the surgery by a retinal specialist, to repair and reattach the retina. The lapse of a few days may be why it was not a successful attachment surgery, but it attached for about 2 weeks. Then over the course of a year, detached 4 more times. I had surgery a total of 5 times, always following the face down protocol of ""face down chair time"" of 10 days face down for each surgery.

Over the past year, I have noticed that when I'm outside, it is way brighter than it was before, to the point that I have to squint or put my hand above my eyes in order to see. Blue lighted signs are extremely blurry, even from close distances, whether it is day or night. I see large halos around light and can even notice them during the day where the sun is reflecting off of objects. Severe Dry eyes have been a daily issue since the surgery was performed. I've tried otc Drops, eye supplements, prescription eye Drops, and punctal plugs, and none of those have relieved my Dry eyes. Drops will help for less than 30 minutes before my eyes start getting Dry again. I'm afraid to get a ""touch-up"" or ""enhancement"" since my initial results were awful. My eye sight is not 20/20 as they have it documented. The last visit I had at (b)(6) I had hard time reading the 20/20 line but they recorded it incorrectly. I asked them if a touch up or glasses would be helpful and they said that it was too soon after the surgery and also that my eye sight isn't bad enough to write a prescription for glasses. When I filed a claim with (b)(4) they basically brushed off the side effects that I listed and focused solely on the recorded 20/20 vision that they recorded. They reviewed my medical history and hinted that my epilepsy medication could be the cause of my blurry vision since it is listed as a side effect. I didn't start my new epilepsy medication until late spring 2016 and didn't notice any issues with my old or new medication that would have been related.

I tried topical fluorometholone but it helps minimally and after I used it for a few months, my intraocular pressure was beginning to increase, so I minimized its use. The same cornea surgeon placed a punctal plug to reduce tear outflow, which helped somewhat. However, I continue to have chronic left eye pain.

I went to one of the best ophthalmologists in my area and he used the most up to date technology and paid a very high price. I was never warned about any of the debilitating side effects that I experienced after lasik. I am young and I have had nothing but eye probleMs since I had lasik. They told me that I would only experience halos and Dry eye for no more than a few weeks and I would have ""hd"" vision. I cannot believe how unregulated this procedure is and how your organization have failed in informing and protecting the public. They told me that I was a perfect candidate. After the procedure, I could not operate for 6 months. My eyes were filled with huge floaters that caused distortion and glare. I have double vision that I never experienced with my glasses. I have severe pain behind my eyes and I cannot sleep at night because of the Dry eyes. My eyes are red all the time. I spent almost (b)(6) on second opinions and other doctors. Most of the doctors protected each other's interest and lied to me about the injuries that had been caused by the lasers that your organization have approved. I finally found a honest retina specialist that had no interest who had done my lasik. He concluded that I suffered from a vitreous detachment. This is alarming because I am not myopic. I was never warned about floaters or virtuous detachment, but I found numerous forMs and studies that link this injury with lasik. I am also suffering from debilitating Dry eye one year after lasik. Lasik has pretty much ruined my life. I used to work on the computer for hours without any issues and I can't even look at the screen for more than 10 minutes. I cannot enjoy the normal things that I used to enjoy like watching tv. I have been suffering e very day since this surgery. I was misinformed and sold on a procedure that is potentially dangerous and harmful. I was never informed about risks like epithelial ingrowth (which I have), Dry eye pain, vertigo, poor eye muscle function, vitreous detachment, red eyes, distorted peripheral vision. I also experienced flashes in my eye. I can't Drive at night and have no social life anymore. When I mention all the probleMs to my doctor he simply ignores me and I know that none of my injuries caused by lasik is being reported. These doctors have a lot of financial interest and downplay how severe lasik complications can be. It seeMs that your organization has done nothing to stop this. I didn't make an informed decision. They gave me a consent form the day of my surgery and I did not have time to review them. This is both unethical and immoral. If someone wants to take risks with their eye sight, they must make an informed decision. These businessmen with md's are making decisions for people without informing them.

My left eye vision has been very blurry ever since the first lasik procedure. My right eye had no pain and saw clearly right after the flap was put back on eye, the left eye was very painful and very blurry (almost blind) right after the flap was put back on eye. It is still very blurry after the flap lift re-treatment in 2014, which removed flap striae and only improved the astigmatism, but not the blurriness. Before the lasik surgery in 2013, I can see clearly (20/20) with normal eye glass (-2.25) for both eyes. My left eye vision is 20/50 now.

I just need to wait for it to get better. I doubt their words. I went to Dr. (b)(6) of (b)(6). He is an expert in treating lasik complications. His evaluation on my left eye shows that my left eye cornea is severely distorted due to the first lasik procedure on (b)(6) 2013, which caused the blurry vision. The recommended solution to my vision problem is to use scleral lens. Both normal eyeglasses and soft contact lens cannot improve the vision, cornea has severe distortion, it cannot focus. Only scleral lens can compensate the irregular cornea. (b)(6) institute keeps persuading me to do prk surgery as the 2nd re-treatment, stating that flap striae was the cause of blurry vision, although they cannot guarantee it will fix the left eye vision problem. I do not trust their words, since Dr. (b)(6) evaluation shows no flap striae, and he can improve my left eye vision to 20/15 by scleral lens. If the blurry vision is caused by flap striae, scleral lens will not be able to improve the vision. Even if prk has some chance to improve the left eye vision, there is very high risk of complications since the left eye already had two laser surgeries. The left eye is already Dry and painful. It is too dangerous to keep on doing surgery on the same eye. Scleral lens is much safer, and it has been proven to be able to improve the left eye's vision to 20/15, better than 20/20.

Eye doctor told me that my left eye is not correctable with add'l surgeries and the only way forward is to wear a hard contact lens which will allow fluid to fill in the imperfections / scars in the cornea preventing the scattering of light.

6875883,2017-09-18,"I wore contact lenses for over 15 yrs and decided I would try to get lasik done as it was marketed as a safe, low risk alternative to relying on contacts. I did some research and figured the technology was advanced and I would go to a place that offered custom wavefront lasik. I passed all the screening and was told I was an ideal candidate, being in my 20s, low prescriptions and in great overall health. The lasik doctors said I could have very little, less than 2% chance of any issues. I tried to cover all of my angles and ask for reassurance that I was a quality candidate and was not at risk for any major issues. I did the lasik and had probleMs that were pretty bothersome months 1 - 6. I kept on the Drops regimen and gave my eyes time to recover. I am 2 years out from the procedure and I still have the Dry itchy eye problem. I go to many specialists and they all say the same thing - severe Dry eye. I spent more than I have spent in 2 years on Drops that I spent on contacts in the previous 15 years. No solution. From my post-lasik experience, I was not an ""ideal"" candidate for lasik. I learned that I have severe meibomian gland dysfunction from having worn contacts for almost all my life. This mgd issue was likely asymptomatic while wearing contacts. Lasik severed my corneal nerves responsible for tear production and in combination with the mgd, has led to severe Dry eye. This was never ever mentioned in the screening for lasik. The medical professionals likely acted in an unethical manner in not properly counseling, screening, or educating me about this. I am a consumer. If the doctor, the expert in a position of trust, does not do the proper diligence - and omits a glaring risk factor- this is just plain wrong. Shame on these people. I am an idiot for having gone through this procedure and I am very unhappy that I have to live with these complications for this necessary procedure. The options for treatment are very costly and cumbersome. Restasis is $500 out of pocket for a 3 month supply. I went to a specialist who charged $6000, more than the $5000+ spent on the original lasik procedure and steroid Drops for the operation. I have done meibomian gland probing, and will do lipiflow in the future as I hate living with this. This severely impacts my daily life and I sometimes wonder why this is legal, as in my book this must have been grossly negligent in the reality vs expectations.

7112204,2017-12-12,"I had lasik surgery and now have a hard time with life in general. I was a longtime contact wearer that never had an issue with contacts in my life. Loved them, they were so good to me over my lifetime. I could have easily worn them until I died and I would never complain. I had people tell me I should get lasik and over the years of it being in the back in my mind, I decided to have it done. I don't think lask centers are upfront and honest enough about what could happen as a result of lasik. This has caused a lot of stress and depression in my life that was totally avoidable and thats the part that hurts the most. What lasik centers should be asking potential candidates is if they are bothered by their contacts and glasses. If the pt replies no, they should tell them that this procedure may not produce perfect results and they may want to stick with what they have been doing all along since it has worked well for them their whole life. If they answer that they are absolutely sick of contacts and glasses and they are told all the risk that could be permanent and still want to go through with it then they are perfect candidates as in it being right for them. This could help weed out the people that lasik is not right for. It's important as a health care professional doctor that patients are fully aware of what they are getting theMselves into so they don't jeopardize their quality of life. It's not right to hand a packet of paper work at the consultation and not go over the risk but, instead talk about all the benefits of course the pt is going to sign up for lasik because he or she has not been warned about the risk of the procedure or the risk are given such low percentages that it makes the pt believe that the odds are in their favor. This is called lying to the pt, not fair at all!!. Telling the pt that ""they may have a little Dry eye"" or ""may have halos for the first couple weeks"" is lying!! No healthcare professional can predict how long these ""side effects which are actually risks"" will last or if they will become ""permanent."" I wish I would have dug a little deeper for the information on lasik because this would have absolutely convinced me that lasik was not right for me and I would have been absolutely fine with buying contacts the rest of my life period.. Instead, I was lead to believe this would be just like wearing contacts. I know that so many people have come in front of the fda court hearing focused on lasik quality of life, depression and suicide. It seeMs as though nothing gets accomplished. These poor people now have to live the rest of their lives with issues that could have been totally avoided and in a world where there are already enough chances of developing all kinds of different diseases and health issues without doctors causing them I think it just really sucks and is unacceptable!! I now hope and pray every night that I am able to one day get some kind of resolution to the probleMs lasik has caused me in my life. This can knock a person's life off track and it simply isn't right to at least not be well informed about the consequences lasik can cause. I was always the happy person that was the backbone for others. Hard worker goof ball kind of guy and now I hate to admit it but, this has defiantly defeated me and it has changed my personality. I once asked someone from the fda how they ever approved of this lasik procedure. The lady said to me ""the laser was approved by the fda but, the surgery wasn't."" what??

One month after surgery I experienced temporary (so I thought) double vision. I did have a couple of good vision years and then started having real issues.

I have esotropia, now my left eye turns in badly and my prism is almost as strong as it can get. When I reach the max on the prism, the only option left for me is corrective surgery on the muscles, which will still leave me with glasses. I also now have the beginning of cataracts. I'm terrified to let any surgeon near my eyes. There are times every day when each eye will see just fine without any prescription (which is not an especially strong one for distance), but then my eyes can never work together without a prism prescription. Then there are times every day when each eye sees distance better with my 3.25 strength, over-the-counter reading glasses (never both eyes at the same time though) I've saved all of the stick-on prisMs from past glasses to use with different reading glasses / distance glasses over the years.

7214769,2018-01-23,"All my life I have pretty much had bad eyesight. I was in 2nd grade when I received my first pair of glasses. I still remember Driving home with my father from the eye Drs and putting them on for the first time and being amazed at how well I could see with them. Back then glasses didn't look as cool and I didn't like to wear them because of the way they were looked at back then. The dork or the weak one was always the one that wore glasses in cartoons and tv shows. As I got older, I started wearing and that is when I found the absolute thing that worked best for me. The older I got the better I was with taking them in and out and even got to a point where I barely needed a mirror to do so. To this day, I still consider contacts one of the best things that really worked for me. They are definitely what made me the most comfortable and I was completely happy with them. Never fussed over contacts ever and that is why I can't believe how my life has turned out now. Over the years of accepting contacts and glasses, I would hear of this thing called lasik. As time went on, I would hear more and more about it from people and how great it was. Going to have vision correction was becoming the norm. A friend at work got it as a gift for her daughter for her graduation. She was someone that I would consider a true friend, always baking desserts and bringing them into work for me, helping me with applying for jobs. The place I work isn't a very friendly work place but, she was someone that I could trust and we became good friends. She would often tell me, you need to get that lasik dude, I'm telling you dude. I never knew why she was concerned about my eyesight but, I guess her daughter had made out great with it and she felt it would be a wise decision for me. I also was hearing about it on the radio all the time and seen by tv commercials so, I decided to look into it online also. Seemed to be a miracle, I found it unbelievable that I had been wearing glasses and contacts my whole life and here this thing was that could correct my eyes in less than 10 mins. Over the years of hearing about it I would become more interested so, I would ask my regular optometrists about it. I had been going to them for years and trusted them. Without hesitation they would tell me how great it was. Never a concern about whether I was happy with contact or anything. I felt that this must be the next step after glasses and contacts. This was just the last step and I was completely free. Besides needing reading glasses when I get older but, I was fine with that and I was only going to need them later in life anyway from what I was told at the lasik consultation. I was told I was a perfect candidate, and after talking to 3 people at the lasik center that all had lasik done. I confidently decided I would get lasik and booked my lasik date. I was nervous, but excited to have what was considered perfect eyesight. I told everyone about it and couldn't wait to tell people how great it is once I had it done. I really thought I was doing something great for myself. On (b)(6) 2017, I had lasik done. I remember joking with my mom that came with me about just turning around and going home instead on our way there. I remember thinking to myself when I was called back to wait to have lasik that I could get up and leave any time. I remember feeling so uncomfortable as I laid down on that table and looked over at the 2 giant machines I would be sitting under. I just felt so scared and honestly to this day, I still don't know how I did it. That (b)(6) was the day everything in my life changed. It was the day I remember and would repeat in my head for the longest time. I had finally went ahead and did it and the results were not at all what I expected. The worse part is it was on the most important part of me. A part of me that I can never get back and has changed me altogether mentally and physically. How can something that decreases your night time contrast sensitivity, makes halos and starburst around lights, makes eyes sensitive to light, causes eye pain that I don't know if it will ever go away and has caused me many nights of grief and crying and feeling suicidal. ""be made out to their words (correct) your vision with little risk"", sounds like a pretty big risk to me. A risk to worsen ones quality of life and if ain't right. ""how does the fda not even acknowledge the repeated bad feedback. How does the fda turn their backs on people who have these issues."" you know, everyone was once someone's child. ""how would you feel if your child went for this surgery that you as a parent thought was a great idea and it totally backfires leaving him or her depressed crying all the time feeling like a tortured animal.

7240946,2018-02-02,"In (b)(6) 2015 I had lasik surgery on both eyes. My complaint begins with a grossly improper and incomplete ""informed consent"" process initially by the auxiliary staff. It was compounded later by the doctors extreme cavalier attitude towards my concerns, questions and expectations of lasik treatment. This misinformation and lack of information is the crux of my complaint with my procedure. My initial lasik consultation was with a screening team and consisted of exaMs done with various devices which provide the doctor with information necessary to do the procedure. Later I was placed in a room by myself with an (b)(6) to view a generic infomercial about the types of lasik procedures that are available and the benefits and complications associated with each. Again, no information was targeted specifically for me. Afterwards an assistant asked if I had any questions and she repeated some of the information from the presentation. She was not able to tell me which procedure was appropriate for my needs and said that should be discussed with the doctor. So the patient leaves with only general lasik information and nothing that pertains specifically to them. Weeks later during my exam with the doctor, he mentioned 2 lasik options for me but immediately took the monovision option off the table. He then described an option which would correct my distance vision in both eyes but I would need readers for near vision. When I asked why that was, he answered that I have presbyopia and lasik cannot correct presbyopia. (misrepresentation). He did not say that lasik cannot correct both near and distance in the same eye (lack of critical information). The manner in which he described the procedure and outcome left me to believe that my distance vision would be perfect and my near vision would be better than pre-surgical but not perfect. Common possible complications associated with lasik treatment were discussed and also how those complications are typically managed. A consent form was emailed to me a few days before surgery. In the body of the consent form, there is no mention that near and distance vision cannot be corrected in the same eye. One of the last pages of the consent form is an addendum. The header of the addendum is ""if you are over 40 and are having your distance vision only corrected, there will be an adverse affect to your near vision. The problem is the addendum starts with, ""if you having your distance vision only corrected..."" from my perspective, I wasn't aware this was my situation. I had no idea the doctor planned to correct only my distance vision. There is no mention that a limitation of lasik is that near and distance vision cannot be corrected in the same eye. This is important and should have been prominently displayed in the generic infomercial the patient views on the (b)(6) in the promotional material provided by the lasik companies and on display in doctors offices, it states that lasik corrects near vision, distance vision and astigmatism... That material fails to state that it cannot be all done at the same time in the same eye! On the day of surgery the doctor said repeatedly, you will have to wear readers for near vision after surgery. I thought he was covering his tail making sure I knew my near vision would be improved but not perfect. I had no idea he was about to make my near vision worse. After surgery when I asked why he didn't tell me my near vision would be worse, he said ""I told you you would need readers and that's the same thing"". Informed consent!

The procedure used a microkeratome for creating the corneal flap and a wavelight ex500 excimer laser. I began experiencing pain a few days after the procedure as a pain/pressure felt in the back of my right eye, which then evolved to being felt throughout the eye, with frequent sharp pain radiating from the front of the eye. The severity of the pain increased steadily for the first 6 months after surgery, including pain episodes that completely incapacitated me for up to three days at a time. My eyes were also very Dry and required preservative free eye Drops and autologous serum eye Drops on an hourly basis. During this time, I was being evaluated approximately twice per month at the clinic that performed my lasik procedure. Five months after my lasik procedure I was informed by the lasik clinic that they were unable to offer me any other treatment options, and that my next step was a referral to a pain specialist. I traveled to several other ophthalmologists at this point and was diagnosed with corneal neuropathy. It has been nearly 15 months since my lasik surgery, and my symptoMs of excruciating pain and Dry eye have not improved despite all the treatment options I have pursued. These treatments include: lotemax steroid eye Drops, autologous serum eye Drops, artificial tears, xiidra eye Drops, gabapentin (antI-convulsant), nortriptyline (antI-depressant), otc pain medications, moisture chamber goggles, prolensa (bromfenac opthalmic solution), night-time eye gels, muro 128, acupuncture, diet changes/supplements, bandage contact lenses, and even proparacaine hydrochloride usp 0.5 percent anesthetic eye Drops.

7572984,2018-06-05,"My name is (b)(6). On (b)(6) 2018, I went all the way to (b)(6) to meet Dr (b)(6) (who also practices in (b)(6)) and find out if he could improve the vision in my right eye (which was damaged by a previous lasik procedure 8 yrs ago in the united states) with topography-guided lasik using the contoura vision system. I spent 4 hrs at his office doing scans and when I finally met with him he told me that he thought there was a 90 to 95 percent chance that he could improve the vision in my right eye by 80 to 90 percent. He told me there was a zero percent chance that it could get any worse. Well he made the vision in my right eye about 80 to 90 percent worse. It's blurry during the day and absolutely horrendous at night. Here are simulations I created in photoshop of what I see now: (b)(6). Before the procedure I had slight hyperopia (only +0.25) in my right eye but was (and still am) struggling with a rare eye disease called monocular polyopia (one eye, many focal points) which causes me to see worse than triple vision due to an irregular astigmatism. After the procedure for the entire first week I knew something was wrong because everything far away was blurry and the monocular polyopia was even more pronounced. He told me before the procedure that I would be ""slightly myopic"" for a ""few days"" after the surgery and that it would be ""temporary."" well it is now 3 and a half months later and my right eye is currently extremely myopic, -1.25. I know this because that is roughly what 5 different autorefractors have said my current prescription is, what every optometrist I've seen has concluded it is after performing a manual test and because this is what feels best when I wear both glasses and contacts. Here are three autorefractor results which show that this is my current prescription: (b)(6). I found out later on that after all the tests his optometrists concluded that my right eye was +1.25 without dilation and +1.75 with dilation. I thought that doesn't make sense because my vision would have been blurry at short distances when it was not. So I contacted my previous lasik surgeon (Dr (b)(6)) and asked what my last prescription was that they recorded for my right eye. He said it was +0.25-0+0.75x120 3 yrs ago. I then contacted the surgeon at (b)(6) and asked what my last prescription was that they recorded for my right eye. She said it was +0.25 with some astigmatism about 10 months ago. So why the discrepancy. I think Dr (b)(6) used inaccurate measurements to design the ablation zone which resulted in a bad outcome. It makes sense that my prescription would end up being -1.25 if he thought it was +1.25 before the procedure when it was actually +0.25. Big mistake. When I presented this info to him via email he ignored it for 10 days. So I contacted his assistant, (b)(4), who glossed right over everything I said and just parroted the same (profanity) line she fed me in previous emails - that my cornea looks more ""regular"", ""normalized"" and ""homogeneous"" now. She completely ignored the simulations in created in photoshop, the autorefractor results, the manual vision test results, my pre-op prescription and my personal report about how much I've been suffering because of this. She glossed right over all of it. This in itself is a form of medical malpractice - negligence. If you read through the email exchange I have linked to below you will see that she ignored more than a dozen very important questions which were/are vital to my recovery in multiple emails.

7600689,2018-06-13,"Lasik was performed on (b)(6) 2017. Since that time, I have required aggressive treatment for continued, ongoing Dry eye that impairs vision and vision quality. Treatments for this have included postop steroids and topical nsaids, followed by prescription eye Drops (currently I am on restasis), along with temporary and now permanent punctal plugs, eye Drops every 30-60 minutes, otc vit e 3 tab qday, and aggressive hydration. Visual acuity 15 months postop is technically 20/20 with both eyes, but 20/25 in each eye and the quality is poor enough that I wear glasses at work. Night Driving now requires use of glasses and sometimes use of brimonidine, which causes a significant Drop in bp (~30mm sbp) so I use this rarely and only if required. This report is to provide additional information to the fda regarding long-term outcomes after lasik. My review of the literature prior to the procedure revealed only small studies with less than 1 year post-op follow up, and poor measures of vision quality (more than simply acuity) and quality of life. I am still at risk for corneal ectasia and possibly increased risk of cataracts, and with the addition of restasis and punctal plugs, long-term unknown risks of infection, scarring, etc. The risk-benefit ratio for most patients is likely not in favor of lasik for the vast majority of patients, but that is difficult to discern in the current published literature. Lasik pre-op should be required to include better, rigorous evaluation for Dry eye and more standardized approaches to Dry eye postoperatively (the nejm review last week was suspiciously heave on new Drugs and is not consistent with my own, now extensive review of the available literature).

I'm 2 yrs out from this prk and the haze is still a major problem in both eyes, in one eye the haze is less prominent but more central; in the other eye the haze is more significant but more peripheral.

Given this, when I am in any indoor area even during the day or even outside when it's cloudy, rainy, etc. (the only time I don't have those symptoMs is outside under the sun) my pupil dilates beyond the 6.5 mm treated area, I see things double, hazy, glares around the lights and blurry, since my brain is getting sight mixed messages from the corrected uncorrected optical zone.

I tried calling the doctor multiple times again, but was told the same, that I need to give it more time.

I went back to tlc for help and was prescribed restasis, which initially helped. The Dr seemed satisfied with how I was doing, told me it would take up to 3 months to experience the full benefit of the restasis and told that if I had further issues to go to my eye Dr. At both visits to tlc, they were aware of the issues I was having and not once was any extensive testing done to determine what was wrong with my eyes. I was slightly better at the three-month mark and wanted to give my eyes more time to see if they would improve, but I was back at my eye Dr. Within a few months. At that time, and after running additional tests, it was determined that my corneas had not healed properly and were not attached as they should be. This came as a complete shock to me, especially after going back to where I had the lasik done and not being told this information. After much discussion with my eye Dr., I decided to undergo prokera, which worked and my vision was perfect for approximately 1 month. Just as suddenly as my vision worsened after lasik, the same thing happened after prokera. Luckily, my insurance allowed me to undergo treatment, an additional time and my vision wasn't as crisp and clear as it was after the first treatment, my vision and comfort level had improved and my corneas had stabilized. Shortly after my prokera treatment, xiidra became available on the market and I began to take that. It helped significantly for the first 6 months and then my eyesight began to worsen once again due to excessively Dry eyes. At that time, I began to use xiidra in conjunction with restasis and my eyes became less Dry and my comfort level had improved enough that I could see fairly well and my eyes were not red and painful. After a year on both Drops, my eyes became red and began to tear excessively. It was discovered that my tear ducts became blocked due to inflammation from my chronic Dry eyes. I was put on a regiment of pred forte for a month, along with my prescription eye Drops, where I would start with 4 Drops a day and taper down to one.

7938839,2018-10-04,"Two years ago, I had lasik surgery, and it has proved to be the worst decision of my life. My eyes had no probleMs previously. I had beyond perfect vision with contacts. It was a gift, and now I really know what I lost. They said I was a perfect candidate, nothing to worry about, it's great, you have large pupils but it is nothing to worry about, etc. I was such a tool. My gut said something seemed off. My sight, along with my confidence has been stolen. The most normal things in life, and many things that gave me such joy, the night sky, concerts, a beautiful landscape, the detail and depth in a design, the face of a friend across the bar, is gone because what I see is not ""right. During the day, the clarity isn't too bad. But what I see in terMs of clarity seeMs to vary day by day. There is no consistency. And when it is sunny. I cannot step outside without sunglasses. The light is so bright, it screaMs and hurts my eyes in a way I cannot describe. At night, it is even worse, I almost cannot Drive. The glare and starbursts distort everything and are debilitating. Images are blurry, depth gone, plus ghosting images, where I panic thinking there is an animal or person or an object in front of me, but it's a shadow or a trick of the light. Reflections of signs are almost 3d. Everything is so dark, as if there are no lights, so it takes 5 times as much light to ""see"" what I know is there. So black, so many things are missing. No shades of gray. I know the stars are still there, millions of them. But I cannot see them anymore. The beauty of the night sky is gone. Soft contacts don't fit. My eyes are misshaped. Scleral lens are so large and uncomfortable. I could barely wear them a few hours. More lasik could make things worse, but so many Drs I talk to dismiss that. Pupil Drops dont work. Glasses provide some help, but not much at night. Hybrid contact lens are the closest I have gotten to restoring my vision, but the lab has refused to help me get them to fit. We only tried 6 pairs, and they kept doing something different each time. And I had different lab techs each time, so no one was on the same page. I've seen 3 Drs since surgery, all said I was not a good candidate. I now know from speaking with them, I was not a good choice for lasik due to my large pupils. The rep at the lasik center said it was nothing to be concerned about. I also feel the car accident I was in in (b)(6) 2017 was no coincidence. All my f/u appts at the lasik center were with a rep, not a Dr, and he kept dismissing my concerns as I needed time to heal. My lasik Dr only saw me once, 10 mins before surgery. That is it. Some Drs say more surgery can fix all these probleMs, but other pts I have spoke with say this is untrue. Some of the Drs dismiss the severity of my probleMs, or they act like some secret cut, and will not truly and completely speak against lasik. At least provide you with real honest risks. I asked for a copy of the contact I signed with the lasik center, and it tacks on ""oh it may be permanent"" or ""oh, this might not go away"" as an after thought on the contract. At no time did the rep or the Dr sit down and explain what could go wrong. It was all happy, rainbows, and this will be great, I trusted my Dr and the lasik people when they said I was a good candidate. Only after I have all these probleMs, that are permanent, does anyone go ""oh yeah, sorry about that."" this is unacceptable. This is my life. So much joy has now been replaced with pure sadness.

Since then, it has worsened, severely. I am an (b)(6), and am beginning to get concerned about the impact on my vocation. A lot of the time, my eyes burn, as though molten lava was poured in them. It hurts, and my vision is blurred during those times especially. Nighttime and the mornings are when they are the worst. It has been about 10 years since my surgery. I remember, the surgeon wasnt confident initially that he could perform my procedure due to the condition of my eyes, until a second doctor came to evaluate me. The second surgeon reassured me that I was a good candidate, and said they could do the procedure successfully. I thought it was the best thing I did for myself for several years. But now, im rethinking my choice. The pain is so severe and my vision is getting worse. I see halos at times, and can barely open my eyes in the mornings, and the effects are lasting longer as time progresses. It is hard for me to focus on a computer screen without my eyes beginning to hurt. The situation is becoming hard to personally manage, which is disconcerting, because it is interrupting my daily life and diminishing my work and normal functioning routine activities. Had I been better counseled by the surgeons, and had the second older and seemingly more experienced doctor not eased my mind about the first doctors apprehensions, I truly would have reconsidered my choice. Knowing what I know now, I would not have undergone the lasik surgery due to the pain im experiencing and the increasing blurriness. Overall, my eyesight is not as bad as it was prior; however, the discomfort, which is a very kind understatement, is truly not worth the improvement that I do encounter with my current general vision.",Halos; Glares; Night Issues; Pain

I experienced permanent bilateral halos, unilateral ""cloudy vision"" of my right eye, decreased night vision, and extreme photosensitivity, as well as frequent and significant eye pain and blurry vision. In 2006, I had lasik again for an enhancement. Unfortunately, my symptoMs did not improve, and in fact, the pain worsened. Some mornings the pain is so intense that even dim light hurts my eyes. They tear significantly when exposed to room light, and even more with sunlight.

8645945,2019-05-24,"I had gone through the relex smile refractive surgery last year ((b)(6) 2018) because I had myopia of -6. Right after leaving the surgery room everything was blurry and the next day my vision turned white. I was told that I had a visible white haze on my cornea by my family members. Not only was I misdiagnosed by my surgeon but he hadn't mentioned any side effects prior to or after the surgery whatsoever. He only told me that I had a ""normal infection"" when I visited the next day, and said that it happens with many of his patients and would disappear within 3 days or so. I wasn't allowed to use lubricating eye Drops and my eyes used to hurt so much and be glued together (I wasn't allowed to wash them either). My surgeon had traveled for vacation right after and I had to see several other doctors to finally know a month from the surgery that I had dlk ( deep lamellar keratitis) type 4 and not an infection. Some say I could have ctk (central toxic keratitis) instead. I was informed by some doctors that the lack of lubricating my eyes had made them worse because I have developed eye Dryness so doctors I had seen recommended to use lubricating eye Drops at all times (which I still currently use). I had been using pred forte and zymaxid like any other lasik patient after the surgery (every 3 hours) and reduced it with time. One of the doctors I had seen recommended doxycycline and I've used it for 3 months but it only gave me a troubled stomach. I do feel a lot better than I had in the 1st 3 months after surgery, but I still see streaks and halos. My eyes are still sensitive to light. My vision is still blurry sometimes but the repetitive images I see are less than before. My vision is not consistent. It changes every now and then and in both eyes I see differently at times. My eyes are also still Dry despite the constant lubrication but they hurt less. Sometimes I see different sizes but I have been gradually seeing colors other than greys, blacks and whites. I can read big signs and texts through a large font and through devices with a dark background, but I do have trouble reading papers, and when I focus too much, I see more rigid repetitive objects. Texts are never fully clear, even the big ones. My left eye has more repetitive images although I feel that vision-wise it is better; my right eye's vision quality is less but the repetitive images are ""currently"" smaller. It used to be the opposite (not constant). I was advised to just wait, because my cornea had become thin after the operation and so none of the doctors recommended cornea transplant operation then and until today and I was told that they could look into it after 2 years (it has been 10+ months now). However, they did mention that it could be very risky simply because none of the doctors know what caused the dlk in my eyes. I would like to know if there are any regulations by the fda for surgeons to inform the patient of all the risks included in the using the relex smile machines. And what are the safety measures for them to take? Is having the procedure on one eye at a time considered a safety measure?

I can't go more than 30 mins without putting Drops in my eyes. Both my under eyes have been swollen or puffy since the surgery, so I walk around in sunglasses all day and all night. It's a nightmare and I just want to die. I fear for my children to grow up without their mother but I don't know how much more pain I can take.

It was not like that the day after surgery. Now the vision in my right eye is always hazy whenever my pupil is dilated to a large size. I am also experiencing severe Dryness in my right eye, more so than my left and occasional discomfort in my right eye. There are no issues in my left eye, seeMs only to be in my right eye. I have also been noticing recently increase in floaters and a new aberration. This new aberration is like a translucent, white, gloss that I can see move around while I'm in an environment with close to complete darkness and a light hitting my eye at an angle. This is the only time I can see the image / aberration. So far there are no other side effects from having lasik done.

Upon f/u with my Dr, he told me it was normal placed a contact patch over one eye. The contact felt like sand paper, when I questioned him, he told me it was normal. The contact was removed five days later. My vision was normal for about a year and then I started to have increased sensitivity and halos in my eyes. In (b)(6) 2009 I was in a head on automobile collision and the air bags were deployed. The chemicals from the air bags were in my eyes. I had to wear an eye patch for six to eight weeks recovery. In 2011, I started to have blurry vision at night. My vision progressed worse and had to wear glasses. I was told that I would have to wear contacts with glasses. No one would tell me what was wrong with my eyes. I requested my medical record. When visiting the eye Dr I was told that I have keratoconus. My Dr never told me that so, when I asked him he said that I really don't have that and that he uses that diagnosis for insurance purposes and my diagnosis was for higher-order aberrations. I have server corneal scarring and would need a cornea transplant. I posted on instagram what was happening to me and someone made comment that I could have ectasia of the eye.

I did my research on the Dr, he is well known and teaches others about lasik. I did not cheap out on my eyes. The only thing that I noticed about 8 months after surgery is the amount of floaters in my left eye. I talked to the Dr about the floaters to make sure my eyes were still healthy and they said it ws normal part of aging and that I most likely had them before the procedure, but couldn't see them. I feel like even though I wore contacts and glasses that I would have noticed these floaters. I wish that I had found all the info about possible floaters after lasik and I would have rethought having this procedure done. The Drs never mentioned this when I asked about side effects. I never knew to specifically look up this issue because I didn't think there was a correlation. It seeMs like lasik does affect sudden floaters and they really need to do more research and warn the general public about this, so they have all the info before having lasik. Now I have 4 friends who have had lasik and they didn't have any floaters, but I also had the worst vision out of all of them, so that may have something to do with why I have these floaters. My eyes are also more sensitive to light which makes it tough working on screens. At this point I regret having my procedure since then I could have avoided all these post-surgery issues.",Astigmatism
